What good is it? This grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. It's pretty vague. Where do you want to start looking? Maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. Let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr.Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact. I've heard this one, as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert 150 years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think. Not ""supposedly,"" Dr.Jones. This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story. It doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would. This tablet is one of those markers. It proves the knight's story is true. But as you pointed out, it's incomplete. Now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother.

What good is it? This grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. It's pretty vague. Where do you want to start looking? Maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. Let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr.Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact. I've heard this one, as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert 150 years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think. Not ""supposedly,"" Dr.Jones. This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story. It doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would. This tablet is one of those markers. It proves the knight's story is true. But as you pointed out, it's incomplete. Now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy. As you can now see, Dr.Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost 2,000 years ago. We're only one step away. That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet. You could be more right than you know. Yes? We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished, along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Dr.Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man, and you will find the Grail. You've got the wrong Jones, Mr.Donovan. Why don't you try my father? We already have. Your father is the man who has disappeared. Your father and I have been friends since time began. I've watched you grow up, Indy. I've watched the two of you grow apart. I've never seen you this concerned about him before. Dad? He's an academic; a bookworm. He's not a field man. Dad? Dad? Dear God. What has the old fool got himself into now? I don't know, but whatever it is, he's in over his head. Dad? It's today's mail, and it's been opened. Mail. That's it, Marcus. Venice, Italy. What is it? It's Dad's Grail diary. Every clue he followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me? I don't know, but someone must want it pretty badly. Do you believe, Marcus? Do you believe the Grail actually exists? The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. But if you want facts, Indy, I've none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith. Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now. I'll tell him we'll take two. All right, tell me what's going to happen when we get to Venice. Don't worry, Dr.Schneider will be there to meet you. Uh, Schneider? I maintain an apartment in Venice.

These columns over here were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades. Now, please excuse me. The library's closing in a few moments. I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer. Marcus... I've seen this window before. Where? Right here, in Dad's diary. You see? Look, Indy. The Roman numerals. Dad was onto something here. Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean. Dad sent me this diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves. Find something? Uh, yes. Three, seven and ten. That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals. My God, I must be blind.

You're up late. It's not so late in Seattle. You're right. What's your wish? My dad needs a new wife. You don't like the one he has? He doesn't have one. Where's your mum? She died. Well, who can believe this? I've been sad, but Dad's worse. Have you talked to him about it? No, that makes him sadder. Jonah, is your dad home? Is he busy? No, he's out on the deck. Can't you ask him to talk to me? Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah! No, he'd kill me. He won't be angry when he hears how concerned you are about him. Want to bet? If he yells, you lose a fan. Dad, there's someone on the phone for you. His name is Sam. If you've just tuned in, tonight's topic is wishes and dreams. We have a listener from Seattle. Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone on Network America. What are you selling? Microhibachis or knives? Neither. I want to help. Your son asked me for advice. He wants to find you a new wife. Who is this? Dr. Fieldstone of Network America. You are on the air. You called a radio station? Sam, are you there? Yes. You mourn your wife's death. Your son is worried about you. Get out here. I won't go through this alone. It's hard for him to talk to you about this. If we talk about it, maybe Jonah will feel better. Talk to her. She's a doctor. Her first name could be Doctor. Please. Sam, it's his Christmas wish. Okay. Good. I know this is difficult. When did your wife die? About a year and a half ago. Have you had any relationships? No. Why not? Marcia... or Dr. Fieldstone? Dr. Marcia. I don't mean to be rude... I don't want to pry... Sure you do. Go on, Sam. I'm listening. We had a pretty tough time at first. But we're dealing with it. Jonah and I will get along fine, as soon as I break his radio. I'm sure you're a wonderful father. You can tell a lot from a voice. Yes, you can. But Jonah still feels that you're under a cloud. Are you sleeping at night? He doesn't sleep at all. How do you know that? I live here, Dad. Look, it's Christmas. Maggie... my wife. She really did it... She loved... She made everything beautiful. It's tough this time of year. Every kid needs a mother. Maybe you need someone too. Yes. We'll resume after these messages. Sam and Jonah, don't go away. I'm talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

Why was your wife so special? How long is your program? It was a million little things. When you added them up, it meant we were meant for each other. I knew it the very first time I touched her.

I was so good that some years later the Army decided that I should be on the AllAmerican PingPong team.

They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name, Forrest Gump. Mama said that the ""Forrest"" part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense. Okay... Get it, get it... Wait, is it this way? Hold on. All right... What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before? Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest. If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs. Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about 1,000 years ago, something like that. Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms, Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that. That's how me and Mama got money. Mama was a real smart lady. Remember what I told you, Forrest. You're no different than anybody else is. Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You're the same as everybody else. You are no different. Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump. Now, his IQ is 75. Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock. She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School. I met the principal and all. I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump. Now, this is normal. Forrest is right here. The state requires a minimum IQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He's gonna have to go to a special school. Now, he'll be just fine. What does ""normal"" mean, anyway? He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is gonna get the same opportunities as everyone else. He's not going to some special school to learn how to retread tires.";0;499;773;0

I didn't know who I might meet, or what they might ask. You ever been on a real shrimp boat? No, but I been on a real big boat. I'm talking about a shrimpcatching boat. I've been working on shrimp boats all my life. I started out on my uncle's boat, that's my mama's brother, when I was about maybe nine. I was just looking into buying a boat of my own and got drafted. My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue. People call me Bubba. Just like one of them old redneck boys. Can you believe that?

You must have a goddamn IQ of 160! You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump! Listen up, people! Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army like one of them round pegs. It's not really hard. You just make your bed real neat and remember to stand up straight, and always answer every question with, ""Yes, Drill Sergeant!"" Is that clear? Yes, Drill Sergeant! Yes, Drill Sergeant! What you do is, you just drag your nets along the bottom. On a good day, you can catch over 100 pounds of shrimp. If everything goes all right, two men shrimping 10 hours, less what you spend on gas, you can... Done, Drill Sergeant! Gump! Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump? You told me to, Drill Sergeant. Jesus H. Christ, this is a new company record. If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump. You are gonna be a general some day, Gump. Now, disassemble your weapon and continue! Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautÃ© it. There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole... shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp... shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich... That's... That's about it.

I got a very important question to ask you. How would you like to go into the shrimping business with me? Okay. Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured out, too. So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent. I'll be the captain, we can just work it together, split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm telling you, 5050. And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat. That's a fine idea. Bubba did have a fine idea. I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it. I sent her letters, not every day, but almost.

I couldn't just let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was, so I grabbed him up and run him out of there. And every time I went back looking for Bubba, somebody else was saying, ""Help me, Forrest. Help me."" Can't hear... Can't hear... No sweat, man. Just lay back. You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

Bubba was gonna be a shrimping boat captain, but instead he died right there by that river in Vietnam. That's all I have to say about that. It was a bullet, wasn't it? A bullet?

I just felt like running. It's you. I can't believe it's really you. Now, for some reason, what I was doing seemed to make sense to people. I mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know? I said, ""Here's a guy that's got his act together. ""Here's somebody who's got it all figured out. ""Here's somebody who has the answer."" I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump. So, I got company. And after that, I got more company. And then, even more people joined in. Somebody later told me it gave people hope. Now... Now, I don't know anything about that, but some of those people asked me if I could help them out. Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering if you might help me, huh? Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business and I've been trying to think up a good slogan. And since you have been such a big inspiration to the people around here, I thought you might be able to help me jump into... Whoa, man! You just ran through a big pile of dog shit! It happens. What, shit? Sometimes. And some years later, I heard that that fellow did come up with a bumper sticker slogan, and he made a lot of money off of it. Another time, I was running along, somebody who had lost all his money in the Tshirt business, he wanted to put my face on a Tshirt, but he couldn't draw that well, and he didn't have a camera. Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway. Have a nice day. Well, some years later, I found out that that man did come up with an idea for a Tshirt. He made a lot of money off of it. Anyway, like I was saying, I had a lot of company. My mama always said, ""You got to put the past behind you before you can move on."" And I think that's what my running was all about. I had run for three years, two months, 14 days and 16 hours. Quiet. Quiet. He's going to say something. I'm pretty tired. Think I'll go home now. Now what are we supposed to do? And just like that, my running days was over. So, I went home to Alabama.

This was your greatgrandfathers war watch, and he wore it every day he was in that war, and... when he'd clone his duty, he went home to your greatgrandmother, took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed... until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country... to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.;0;5865;5941;0

This time they called it World War II. Your greatgrandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Dane was a Marine, and he was killed, along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death. He knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive, so three days before the Japanese took the island, your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki a man he'd never met before in his life to deliver to his infant son, who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.;0;5941;6051;0

Hopefully... you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were... for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.;0;5746;5828;0

If it'd been me who'd not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim. But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you. Butch... I got something for ya. This watch I got here... was first purchased by your greatgrandfather during the First World War. It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches. Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches. It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge... on the day he set sail for Paris. This was your greatgrandfathers war watch, and he wore it every day he was in that war, and... when he'd clone his duty, he went home to your greatgrandmother, took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed... until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country... to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War II. Your greatgrandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Dane was a Marine, and he was killed, along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death.;0;5828;5972;0

Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch. This watch.

Do you realise that I work at home? No. I wasn't aware. Do you like to be interrupted when you're nancing around in your little garden? No, no, I... No, no. I actually will turn the ringer off on my phone and sometimes put a piece of cardboard in... Well, I work all the time. So never, never interrupt me. Okay? Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home... and one week later, there's a smell coming from there that can only be... a decaying human body, and you have to hold a hankie to your face... because the stench is so thick that you think you're gonna faint. Even then, don't come knocking. Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you want to celebrate because some fudge packer that you date... has been elected the first queer president of the United States, and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with. Even then, don't knock. Not on this door. Not for any reason. Do you get me, sweetheart? Yes. It's not a... subtle point that you're making. Okay, then. So, the theory of confrontation says now he'll think twice before messing with me. All right. ""Love was..."" What was love? ""Love was..."" Now I'm pissed. Now I am really pissed. Hoo. Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't touch. Shut up. You think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but you don't intimidate me. I grew up in hell, homeboy. My grandmother had more attitude. Police. Doughnutmunching morons. Help me. Help me. Help me. Shut up. Assault and battery, and you're black. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognisable... if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch that dog again. Meantime, I'm gonna think of some way that you can make it up to him.

You're all better, huh? Huh. It's that new medication. So you know all my son's stuff, right? No, no, no, no. I got a date tonight. I'm walking out the door, he says to me, ""Mum, I promise not to get one of my fevers or coughs during your date."" Isn't that sweet? Little blond angel. Eats everything. It just came out.

So now you're saying he's not a racist prick, you just don't like him. Yes, sir. That's not a good enough reason. Then I guess I should think of a better one and get back to you. So you think I'm asking you to make one up. Uh, no, sir. I just can't think of one... right now. You wanna know what I heard? I heard it was a case of uncontrollable flatulence. You want me to say he has flatulence? Not him. You. You have uncontrollable flatulence. You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody else so you're requesting a oneman car. I'm not... comfortable with that, Lieutenant. I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand your need for privacy. Just like I'm sure you understand how hard a black man has to work to get to, say, where I am, in a racist fucking organization like the L.A.P.D. And how easily that can be taken away. Now, that being said, it's your decision. You can put your career and mine on the line in pursuit of a just cause, or you can admit to having an embarrassing problem of a personal nature.

We have attorneys for this slain police officer camping in our offices. We have his mother and a half dozen men of the cloth who swear that Lewis was one of the twelve apostles of Christ.

And even if it was, we aren't going to prosecute a dead man. Which means the money Internal Affairs is holding can't be considered evidence. You can do this dance if you want to, but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report comes back tomorrow it's going to say that Detective Lewis was coked out of his head. Fucking black people, huh? What did you just say? I mean, I know all the sociological reasons why per capita eight times more black men are incarcerated than white men. Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity. Bias in the judicial system. All that stuff. All that stuff! But still, it's gotta get to you, on a gut level as a black man. They just can't keep their hands out of the cookie jar. Of course, you and I know that's not the truth. But that's the way it always plays, doesn't it? And assholes like Lewis keep feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

Why don't you cut through the bullshit and just tell me what it is you want. The D.A.'s squad loses its lead investigator next month. Rick is quite adamant that his replacement be a person of color. It's a highprofile position, and he wants to send the right message to the community. And the right message is, ""Look at this black boy I just bought?"" Well, fuck you very much.

So all, uh... all I need to do to make this disappear is to frame a potentially innocent man? What are you? The fucking defender of all things white? We're talking about a white man who shot three black men. And you're arguing with me that maybe we're not being fair to him? You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe Lewis did provoke this. And maybe he got exactly what was coming to him. Or maybe stoned or not, just being a black man in the Valley was enough to get him killed. There was no one there to see who shot first, so there is no way to know. Which means we could get this wrong. Maybe that's what happened with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong. Maybe Lewis isn't the only one who deserves the benefit of the doubt. You're the one closest to all this. You need to tell us. What does your gut tell you?";0;6181;6527;0

We're talking about a white man who shot three black men. And you're arguing with me that maybe we're not being fair to him? You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe Lewis did provoke this. And maybe he got exactly what was coming to him. Or maybe stoned or not, just being a black man in the Valley was enough to get him killed. There was no one there to see who shot first, so there is no way to know. Which means we could get this wrong. Maybe that's what happened with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong. Maybe Lewis isn't the only one who deserves the benefit of the doubt. You're the one closest to all this. You need to tell us. What does your gut tell you? So? Graham? What do I tell 'em?

I have to actually wear a frickin' bra now and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff on myself so, like... I don't know, my skin won't explode. Hot. Why is everyone always staring at me? Well, you are kind of convex, you know. Whoauh! Who's been doing their geometry homework for once? I have no choice. Keith's been grading me, like, so hard lately. Do not call Mr. Connors Keith. Why? 'Cause my barf reflex is really heightened these days. But Keith's hot. Ew, he's all beardy. Did you hear that Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort? Katrina?! No, way, no, he doesn't like Katrina. Must be, like, a pity date or something. I heard he asked her. And that they're going to Benihana and then prom and then Vijay's parents' cabin. Oh, what're you talk... He told me that Katrina's house smells like soup. Oh. Oh, my God, it totally does. I was there, like, four years ago for a birthday party. Oh, my God, it's like Lipton Landing. But, you know, boys have endured way worse things for nookie. Oh, please. There is no way that they're having sex. I mean, they wouldn't even be holding hands. Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. He did it with you. Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me, you know. We're best friends. Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did. Not jealous, don't care. It's just, I know Bleek doesn't like Katrina, you know. He shouldn't toy with her emotions like that, 'cause she seems pretty nice. Uhhuh, I'm really convinced. You know, prom is for weenuses anyway. As soon as you you're old enough to go, it's so not cool anymore. Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort? Uh, hi. Leah justjust said that you were going to go with her. Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. Um, a bunch of us from the team are going to go to Benihana and then go to the prom and then go to Vijay's parents' cabin, so... Wewewe're getting a stretch limo. Your mom must be pretty stoked that you're not taking me. You're mad. Why are you mad? I'm not mad. I'm in a... I'm in a great mood. I mean, despite the fact that well, I'm in a fat suit that I can't take off and despite the fact that pretty much everyone's making fun of me behind my back and despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stink eye in art class yesterday... Katrina's not my girlfriend, all right? And I doubt that she gave you the stink eye. That's just... the way her face looks, you know. That's just her face. Yeah, what... Youyou just take Soupy Sales to prom. I can think of so many cooler things to do that night. Like, you know what, Bleek? I might pumice my feet. I might go to Bren's dumb Unitarian Church. Maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice, you know, 'cause all those things would be exponentially cooler than going to prom with you. You're being really immature. You have no reason to be mad at me. I mean, you know, you broke my heart. I... I should be royally ticked off at you, you know. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore. Ooh, what, 'cause I got bored and had sex with you and I didn't want to, like, marry you? Like I'd marry you? You'd be the meanest wife ever, okay? And I know that you weren't bored that day, because there was a lot of stuff on TV, andand the Blair Witch Project was coming on Starz. And you were like, ""I haven't seen this since it came out."" And if so, we should watch it. And then but, ""Oh, no, we should make out instead,"" la, la, la. You just, you just take Katrina the douche packer to prom.

There's just some things that I still want to do. Like what? Be a rock star? Don't mock me. I'm just saying that this is... this is something that's never going to happen. You know... your shirt is stupid. Grow up. If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a mother. I never said I'd be a good father. I called Gerta Rouse and she said that she can represent both of us. It's called a ""collaborative divorce."" It's all the rage right now, supposedly.

No, I don't, I mean, who is the father, Juno? Um... It's... it's Paulie Bleeker. Paulie Bleeker? What? I didn't think he had it in him. I know, right? Right. This is no laughing matter. No, it's not.

Yeah, yeah, and it, there's this couple they haven't had, you know, they've been trying to have a kid for, like, five years. We found them in the PennySaver next to the exotic birds. And they have a legitimate lawyer and I was gonna go meet with them next weekend. June bug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. It's probably tougher than you can understand right now. Oh, I... I know. And I... it's just that I'm not ready to be a mom. Damn skippy, you're not. You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds. That was once, and she did not die, if you recall. Honey, had you considered you know... the alternative? No. Well, you're a little Viking. First things first. All right, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Figure out where you're going to deliver. Juno, I'm coming with you to meet this... adoption couple. You're just a kid. I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wing nuts. Thanks, Dad. Boy, I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when. I don't really know what kind of girl I am. Whoa. Just tell it to me straight, Bren. You think this is my fault? I think kids get bored and they have intercourse. And I think June bug was a dummy about it, Mac. I am not ready to be a Pop Pop. You're not gonna be a Pop Pop. Somebody else is gonna find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. Did you see that coming when she sat us down here? Yeah, but I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs. That was my first instinct, too, or a DWI. Anything but this. And I'm gonna punch that Bleeker kid in the wiener next time I see him. Mac. Come on. You know it wasn't his idea. Yeah. Hi. I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno. Mr. MacGuff, hi. Vanessa Loring. It's, uh, Vanessa, right? Is that...

I have Pellegrino or vitamin water or... orange juice with... I'll have a Maker's Mark, please. Up. She's kidding. June bug has a wonderful sense of humor, just one of her many genetic gifts. I'll sit down. So, Juno, first off, how far along are you? I'm a junior. No, I mean, in your pregnancy. Oh, right. Um, well, actually my stepmom took me yesterday to the doctor, and they said I was 12 weeks. That's great. That's marvelous. So you're into your second trimester. Uh... yeah. Apparently. I'm due on May fourth. Great. My girlfriends tell me that the first couple of months are the hardest. I didn't notice it at all, actually. Uh, I'm more concerned about when they have to put that, like, elastic band, you know, in the front of my jeans. I think pregnancy's beautiful. Oh, you're lucky it's not you. Let's talk about how we're gonna do this thing. What do you mean, don't I just have the thing, squeeze it on out and hand it over? Mark and Vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption. Uh, wait, what does that mean? It means they'd send annual updates, photos, let Juno know how the baby is doing. As he, or she, grows up. Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want photos or any kind of notification. You know. I mean... Can't we just, like, kick this old school? You know, like, II stick the baby in a basket send it your way, like Moses in the reeds? Technically, that would be kicking it Old Testament. Exactly. Right? Do you know what I mean? Like in the good old days, when it was quick and dirty. Well, then... we all agree? A traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved. Shit. Yes. Just close 'er on up. Obviously we would compensate you for all your medical expenses. Are you looking for any other type of compensation? Excuse me? What? No. No, I don't want to, you know, sell the thing. I just... I want... I just want the baby to be with people who are gonna love it and be good parents, you know? Um... I mean, II'm in high school. Dude, I'mI'm just... I'm illequipped. Well, you're doing a beautiful and a selfless thing for us. Vanessa's wanted a baby ever since we got married. I want to be a mommy so badly. You don't say. Have you ever felt like you were just born to do something? Yes. Heating and airconditioning. There you go. I was born to be a mother. Some of us are. How about you, Mark? Are you, uh... looking forward to being a dad? Mmm. Betcha. Yeah. Every guy wants to be a father, wants to coach the soccer team and help out with the science fair... the volcano goes off... I don't know. Yeah. All that. Maybe Gerta could take us through the preliminary documents that you've drawn up. Sweet. Yeah, uh, could I use the facilities first? 'Cause being pregnant makes me pee like Seabiscuit. Sure. The downstairs bathroom's being retiled, but if you go upstairs and then to the right and to the... Oh, yeah. The room with the toilet. Is she all right? Oh! It's you. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't expect to see you up here. Just came up to get something. Did your wife send you up here to spy on me? No. What? Do we come off as paranoid yuppies or something? Well, I... I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume. Really? It's Clinique Happy. Get a whiff of those sparklin' top notes. Oh, yeah. That supposed to make me feel... happy? You should feel happy, homes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life sweet, screaming, pooping life and you don't even have to be there when it comes out all covered in, um... Viscera. Blood and guts. Uh... Whoa! Is that a Les Paul? Yes, it is. Vanessa gave me my own room for all my stuff. She gave you your own room in... in... in... in your whole house for your... for your stuff? Wow. She's got you on a long leash there, Mark. Oh, it's beautiful! You know, I always loved Gibson more than Fender. Like, just... What do you play? Um... I rock a Harmony. Oh. Is it mahogany? Yeah. And what happens if you crack the neck? I mean, that must be, like, a bitch to... Tell me about it. I used to play in this real tight band when I lived in Chicago, and this one night we opened up for the Melvins, and I busted that thing right onstage. It cost me $800 just to get it fixed. Whoa. So... so when was that? Was that, like...? '93. Best time for rock 'n' roll. Nuhuh! '77! Are you...? What?! Punk, volume number one! You're crazy. You weren't there. You couldn't understand the magic. You weren't even alive! What's that? It's a Pilates machine. What do you make with it? You don't make anything. It's for exercising. Yeah, my wife ordered one of those, uh... Tony Little ""Gazelles"" off the TV. You know, from the guy with the ponytail? Guy just doesn't look right to me. I'll be right back. Excuse me. #... really want to # # Really, really want to, and I do, too # # I want to be... # Hi. Hi. You're playing music. Juno wanted a little closer look at Kimber. Your guitar is named Kimber? Yeah. That's cool. My ax is named Roosevelt, but after Franklin, not Ted. Franklin he was the hot one with the polio? Yeah. Um... hey, Gerta's downstairs. We still have... we still have a lot of stuff to go over and do. I got it. I got it. You got it? Got it. Not to interrupt the jam session, but... Just look these over. If you have any questions, call me at my office. We would really appreciate if you would just, you know, keep us updated on any doctor's appointments or ultrasounds or anything of that nature, if it's not too much... No. Right. For sure. You want to know how your kid's acookin'. I get it. You think you're really going to do this, then? Yeah. Yeah. No. I... I like you guys. Yeah. How sure would you say you are? Like... Would you say you're 80% sure, or 90% sure or...? I'm going to say I'm about 104% sure. Really? Here you go, sir. No, seriously, if I could just have the thing, and give it to you now, I totally would. But I'm guessing it looks, probably, like a sea monkey right now, and, you know, we should let it get a... get a little... get a little cuter. Right? Yes. That's great. Keep it in the oven. I think that's a great idea. Nice to meet you both. You, too. Please drive carefully. Hopefully, we'll hear from you soon. Thank you. Thank you. All right. You take care. All right. Byebye. Hmm? Honey... Come here. # I'm sticking with you # # 'Cause I'm made out of glue # #Anything that you might do # # I'm gonna do, too... # Hey, man. Hey, Vijay. How's it going? Did you hear? Juno MacGuff's pregnant. Yeah. Like our moms and teachers. Yeah. Did you hear it's yours? Yep. What a trip, huh? I don't really know too much about it. You should grow a mustache. I can't. Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants. Raise my sperm count. See ya. # 'Cause I'm made out of glue # #Anything that you might do # # I'm gonna do, too. # Juno, hey. Hey, Bleek. Me and some guys are going to go to the movies after school, and we're going to doughnut that flick with the guy who has 18 kids. You want to come? Oh, it... sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound. Oh, really? Can I, uh... Should I come, you think? Aw, you... you can't waste those... those doughnut holes there. I... But maybe I could, you know, drop by later. Okay. Cool. Later, Bleek. See ya. I'll save you a seat. There's your baby. Ah! Oh! Oh, my God! There's a hand. Oh! Oh! And an arm. And there's the feet. Oh! Would you look at that? Whoa! Check out Baby Big Head! Dude, that thing is freaky looking. Excuse me I am a sacred vessel, all right? All you've got in your stomach is Taco Bell. It's amazing that there's actually saps that cry at this. What? I'm not made of stone. Well, there you have it. Would you like to know the sex? Yes. No. Please, Juno. Please! No. Definitely no. There's no sex. Planning to be surprised when you deliver. Well, no, I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if you told me, I'll just, like, ruin everything. Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school? No, no, no. They're the adoptive parents. Oh. Well, thank goodness for that. What's that supposed to mean? I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment to raise a baby in. How do you know that I'm so poisonous, you know? Like, what if these adoptive parents turn out to be, like, evil molesters? Or, like, stage parents? They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that? No. I guess not. Yeah. What is your job title exactly? I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am. Well, I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know. Excuse me? Oh, you think you're so special 'cause you get to play picture pages up there? My fiveyearold daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she's not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade? Bren, use a dick! I love it! # Dearest, though you're the nearest to my heart # # Please don't ever # # Ever say we'll part # #You scold # #And you are so bold # #Yes, together, yeah # # I'm going to treat you right # #Yeah, I'm going to treat you right. # Juno. Wow! I didn't expect to see you here. I... I have something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here? Uh... nope. Actually, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue as much time off as she can before the... Oh, right. I hear these are quite the time suck. Yeah. You want to come on in? I'm just having a ginseng cooler. Would you like one? What is it with you rich people and your herbinfused juices? It's probably got something to do with those 44packs they come in. They're not bad, though. Wait a second. Why aren't you at work? I work mostly from home. I'm a composer. No shit? Like Johann Brahms or...? No. More commercial stuff. Like what? Commercials. Oh. Yeah. Have you seen the ads for the Titanium Power men's deodorant? Mmm! Uhhuh. Mmmhmm. #Titanium Powerrrr # # Get more snatch by the baaatch. # Right. Paid for this kitchen. Whoa! You're quite the sellout, Mark. I mean, what would the Melvins say? Did you say you had something to show me? Behold, good sir, your future child. Hey, look at that. I think it looks like my friend Paulie. Is he also bald and amorphous? No. He's the dad. Oh. Wow. Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl? Um... I can't. The doctor can. But I kind of want it to be a surprise. Well, it can only go one of two ways. That's what you think. I mean, I drink tons of booze, so you might end up with one of those scary neuter babies that's born without junk. Junk, huh? Yeah. You know, its parts. I know what junk is. Yeah, right. We definitely want it to have some junk. Please. You don't need to worry about a thing. My stepmom, Bren, makes me eat super healthy, you know? I can't stand in front of the microwave, and no red M I hope you're ready. Ooh. Do you hear that? What? This is my favorite song. This is Sonic Youth doing ""Superstar"" by the Carpenters. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the Carpenters. Chick drummer, freaky dude not unlike the White Stripes. You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Just listen. #Your guitar # # It sounds so sweet and clear... # Yeah. Yeah, I like this. What... what did you say your favorite band was? Didn't. It's a threeway tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways. I am definitely making you some CDs, at least while my kid's in there. # Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby... # The Wizard of Gore? That is Herschell Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror. Please! Dario Argento is so the ultimate master of horror. Argento? He's... he's all right. But Lewis is completely demented. Okay? We're talking about buckets of goo. I mean, there's red corn syrup all over the place. There's fake brains coming out the yinyang. Quite frankly, this looks a little stupid. Give me the tape. Ugh... This is even better than Suspiria. What'd I tell you? Kudos. You have decent taste in slasher movies. Here's to dovetailing interests. Have you guys thought of any names for the baby yet? Uh, sort of, yes. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl. Madison? Wait, hold on. Isn't that, like, a little... gay? Wow, pretentious much? Should everyone just have a mysterious name like Juno? No... you see, my dad went through this huge obsession with Roman and Greek mythology. So he decided to name me after Zeus' wife. I got it. Zeus, like, he had tons of lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. And she was supposed to be, like, really beautiful, but really mean. Like Diana Ross. That suits you. Thanks? You are something else. Ah... There's Vanessa. You'd better go. What? Why? She hates when I sit around and I watch movies and I don't contribute. No, I'll handle this. I'm really good at defusing momtype rage. No, no, Juno... Hey, seriously... Hey, Mark, where are you?! I got some stuff... Hey, Vanessa. Juno. What's going on? Oh, nothing. What are you doing here? What's wrong? I went to the doctor today. Is something wrong with the baby? The baby's great. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today. Here. It's a baby. Oh... It's your baby. Kind of looks like it's waving, you know. Like it's saying... ""Hey, Vanessa, will you be my mom?"" Oh, it kind of does. Right? Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today. Yeah, I came as soon as I got that ultrasound goo off my pelvis. It was crazy actually. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech and we got escorted off the premises. Wow, what kind of swag did you score? Mall madness, huh? It's just some stuff I picked up for the baby. Don't you usually get all that stuff at like a baby shower? 'Cause my stepmom she was pregnant with my little sister and she got a million gifts, you know? But I wasn't jealous, 'cause they all super lame. I doubt anyone's going to throw us a shower. Why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower? I don't think people know... how to feel about the situation because it's... not set in stone. What isn't set? No, no, no, no, no. You don't think that I'm going to flake out on you? No, I don't, Juno. We went through a situation before where it didn't work out. Yeah, cold feet. Oh. You should have gone to China. You know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods. You know, they pretty much just put them in those Tshirt guns and shoot them out at sporting events. Your parents are probably wondering where you are. Nah. I mean, I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into? Though, I should... I should probably bounce. Hey, don't forget your bag. Oh, bag. Thank you. Okay, take care. Where the hell have you been, June bug? I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. I ended up staying for a couple hours. A couple hours?! What are you going over there in the first place? Oh, they just... you know, they wanted to know about the stuff and I said I'd keep them updated, so I did. Well, you could have mailed it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus Nowhere? # Mmmm! # I just did. You know, and while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa, we, uh, we watched The Wizard of Gore and then he burnt me a couple CDs of this weird music. So, it was cool. He's kind of cool. Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that. No, it... it was not a big deal. He was totally cool with it. You don't understand. Mark is a married man. There are boundaries. Oh, come on. Listen, Brenda... Now you're acting like you're the one who has to go through this. Like you're the one who has to get huge and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else. And what does it even matter if he's married? I can have friends that are married. It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage. You don't know anything about me. I know enough. We don't even have a dog. Yeah, we don't have a dog because you're allergic to their saliva. I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno, and in a couple years, when you move out, I'm going to get Weimaraners. Oh, dream big. Oh, go fly a kite! Hey, Juno. What can I do for you? Uh, Bleeker home? Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once, but now she looks like a hobbit. You know the fat one that was in The Goonies? Hey, man. Don't concentrate so hard. I think I can smell your hair aburnin'. Hey, what's up? Not much. I just... wanted to come say hey. I mean, I miss like... just hanging out with you on school nights, you know. Orange tic tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice. The day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious. Boy, you really... really seem to be getting, uh, pregnanter these days. Yeah. You know, I set up this whole private adoption, and this... this married couple in like St. Cloud, they're... they're going to be the parents. So, it's... Really? Yeah. Wow, what are they like? Well, I mean, the guy he's awesome. His name is Mark and, um... he likes old horror movies and he plays the guitar. We actually hung out this afternoon. Is that normal? Probably not, but... Listen, I talked to Dad and Bren and they said they wouldn't narc you out to your folks, so... Okay. I think we should be cool, you know? That's a relief. I'm gonna start looking like a pretty big dork soon. You still going to think I'm cute when I'm huge? I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful. Geez, Bleek. I do. Hey, June bug, you know, when this is all over we should get the band back together. Yeah. I mean, that would be... that would be awesome. I mean, once Tino gets the new drumhead, we're just, like, ready to rock. And, I mean, we could... we could always get back together, too. It's an option. Oh... were we together? Yeah, we were once, you know... that... that time. What about Katrina De Voort? You could totally go out with Katrina De Voort. I don't like Katrina. She smells like soup. I mean, have you ever smelled her? And her whole house smells like soup. Okay... So we have custard and cheesecake. They're yellow. Right. I wanted to pick something that was genderneutral until we get the baby and then we can just add a more decisive palette. Why does everybody think yellow is genderneutral? I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom. It's for babies. I'm thinking more custard. Just with this light. I don't know, maybe I should I should paint a larger swatch or just try it on a different wall... Or you can wait a few more months. Like the baby's going to come storming in here demanding dessertcolored walls. What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for the woman. Especially if you're adopting. It's called ""nesting."" Nesting? Yeah. Are you going to build a crib out of sticks and spit? Hmm? Well, you should read the book. I flagged the daddy chapters. They're... I think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion. I disagree. This wall is going to need something. Our first family photo right in the middle. Right up there. Can you see it? Yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut. Well, share the love, sweetie. No, you can't have any. She's assaulting me. She's denying me freshbaked goodness. Oh, my God. What? That's her. That's Vanessa Loring. Of the PennySaver Lorings? Dude, she's, like, really pretty. You sound, like, totally shocked or something. She's totally going to, like, steal that little kid for her collection. Right? Seriously. Boring. Ah... Oh, I could so go for, like, a huge cookie right now with, like, a lamb kebab simultaneously. God, spermie, must you always feed? It's like never ending, pretty much, you know. Juno! Hi. Hi, Juno. Vanessa, what, what brings you to the mall today? I was just shopping, you know, with my girlfriends, and... You're gay? No. Oh, please, just ignore her. Okay. Well, how are you feeling? Great. Everything's stupendous, you know. Oh, coming in on that snooze button. Wow. It's incredible. Huh. Oh, God. What? Kicking... kicking away. Could... could I feel it? Are you kidding? Oh. God, that's cool. Everyone's just, like, grabbing my belly all the time. It's crazy, but I'm a legend, you know. They call me the cautionary whale. I can't feel anything. It's not moving for me. Well, you should try talking to it, 'cause, like, supposedly they can hear you even though it's all, like, 10,000 leagues under the sea. Hi, baby. Um... It's me. It's... Vanessa. I can't wait to meet you. Can you hear me, baby? Sweet ángel? I felt him! Oh, God. That was magical. Thank you. Thank you. # Elope with me, Miss Private # #And we'll sail around the world # # I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl # # How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take? # # How many nights of limping 'round some pagan holidays? # # Oh, elope with me in private # #And we'll set something ablaze # #A trail for the devil to erase... # #And... if you can't, if you can't decide # # Between a little breakfast and lunch # #Why don't you microwave yourself # #A little bowl of brunch? # Hello?

When you're used to listening to the raw power of Iggy and The Stooges, everything else just sounds kind of like... precious in comparison. Well, I imagine you've got a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point. Well... consider it your musical education. Can't wait to see what you've got to teach me. Stop surfing porn and get back to work. I just wanted to call and say hi. Right. Go learn something. I'll have a little trip down Mexico way. And Greece and China apparently. How many months has it been now? You're getting huge. Oh, it's honing in on eight. You should see how weird I look naked. I wish my fun bags would get bigger. God, trust me, you don't. I have to actually wear a frickin' bra now and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff on myself so, like... I don't know, my skin won't explode. Hot. Why is everyone always staring at me? Well, you are kind of convex, you know. Whoauh! Who's been doing their geometry homework for once? I have no choice. Keith's been grading me, like, so hard lately. Do not call Mr. Connors Keith. Why? 'Cause my barf reflex is really heightened these days. But Keith's hot. Ew, he's all beardy. Did you hear that Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort? Katrina?! No, way, no, he doesn't like Katrina. Must be, like, a pity date or something. I heard he asked her. And that they're going to Benihana and then prom and then Vijay's parents' cabin. Oh, what're you talk... He told me that Katrina's house smells like soup. Oh. Oh, my God, it totally does. I was there, like, four years ago for a birthday party. Oh, my God, it's like Lipton Landing. But, you know, boys have endured way worse things for nookie. Oh, please. There is no way that they're having sex. I mean, they wouldn't even be holding hands. Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. He did it with you. Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me, you know. We're best friends. Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did. Not jealous, don't care. It's just, I know Bleek doesn't like Katrina, you know. He shouldn't toy with her emotions like that, 'cause she seems pretty nice. Uhhuh, I'm really convinced. You know, prom is for weenuses anyway.";0;1377;5670;0

Just like this. Have you ever been to a dance before? Dances are for nerds and squares. What are you? I don't know. Does it feel like there's something between us? #All the young dudes # # Hey, dudes # # Carry the news # #Where are you? # # Stand up # # Carry the news # I'm leaving Vanessa. # Carry the news # What?!

I thought you'd be cool with this. Cool? I I want things to be perfect. I don't want them to be shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Look, I'll have the baby, and Vanessa's going to be so happy. You just... A baby's not going to fix everything, besides I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father. But you're old. How do you think of me? You know, why are you over here?;1;6195;6263;1

I mean, you know, I got stuff in boxes. You know, I'm underground. That's appealing to you? Is this my fault? No. Is Vanessa, like, mad at you because of me or something? That's got nothing to do with it. Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore. Well, you were in love when you married her. And if you're in love once, you can be in love again like my friend, Leah, who's been with the same guy, like, four different times. You're just not trying hard enough. I'm such an idiot. I can't believe what an idiot I am. No, no, you know what, Mark... Just do not divorce your wife. Will you please just do me a solid and stay with Vanessa? You're so young. Oh, I'm not that young. Okay, I'm 16. All right, I'm old enough to know when someone's acting like a total ahole. Oh, and you know what? I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks! It's just noise. Juno? What's going on? Nothing. Why are you crying? I'm not crying, I'm just allergic to fine home furnishings. Hold on. What's the matter? What's the matter? Just a little hormonal. Right, Juno? Just part of the process. What did you do? I didn't do anything. Just, um... I've been thinking... What? You know, I've just I'm thinking if this is the right thing. What are you talking about? Just wondering if it's... just wondering if we're ready. Yeah, we're ready. We're ready. We've read the books. We've taken all the classes. We've have a nursery that is completely... Vanessa. I know we're prepared. I'm just wondering if... I'm ready. Wait a minute. Wait, Juno, don't listen to him. He's just got cold feet. He's just being a guy. The books all say the same thing. ""A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant. A man becomes a father when he sees his baby."" He's going to get there. He's... he's going to get there. It happened so fast. You know, we put the ad in the paper and I thought that it was going to take months, if at all, and then, two weeks later, she's on that couch. Well, she answered our prayers. Ever since then, it's been, like, a ticking clock. What are you saying? That it feels a little like bad timing. What would be a good time for you, Mark? There's just some things that I still want to do. Like what? Be a rock star? Don't mock me. I'm just saying that this is... this is something that's never going to happen. You know... your shirt is stupid. Grow up. If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a mother. I never said I'd be a good father. I called Gerta Rouse and she said that she can represent both of us. It's called a ""collaborative divorce."" It's all the rage right now, supposedly. It'd be pretty easy 'cause we don't have any children. Thanks for making the call, I guess. Have you found a place to stay yet? Yeah, downtown. A hotel? No, it's not a hotel, it's a loft. Well, aren't you the cool guy. I wanted a baby so bad. I know. This looks like a bill from Jun... It's for me. I never realize how much I like being home unless I've been somewhere really different for a while. Hey, Dad. Hey, big puffy version of June bug. Where you been? Oh, just out dealing with things way beyond my maturity level. Where is everybody? Well, Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot iceskating class. When will you guys learn that tots can't iceskate? You're looking a little morose, honey. What's eating you? Oh... I'm just, like, losing my faith with humanity. Wow, can you narrow that down for me? I just... wonder if, like, two people can stay together for good. You mean, like couples? Yeah, like... people in love. Are you having boy trouble? 'Cause I got to be honest, I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition. That's... that's kind of messed up. No, Dad, it's not... I mean, that's pretty skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it skanky? Skivvy? Please stop. Tore up from the floor up? That's... that's not what it's about, it... I just... I need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever. Well, it's not easy, that's for sure. And, uh, I don't have the best track record in the world, I know, but... I've been with your stepmother for ten years now, and, um, I'm proud to say, we're very happy. Look... in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood... ugly, pretty... handsome, what have you. The right person's still gonna think the sun shines out your ass. That's the kind of person that's worth sticking with. Yeah. Yeah, and I think I've found that person. Yeah, sure you have your dear old DAD. You know I'll always be there to love you and support you no matter what kind of pickle you're in. Obviously. Dad, I think I'm just gonna like... shove out for a sec, but I won't be home late. Okay. You were talking about me, right? Oh, yeah. Come on! Tic tac ahoy!";0;6263;7274;0

There are just a few things about Marley you're gonna need to know. He eats three times a day. If he looks starved, feed him again. Now, of course, all of this food is gonna have to go somewhere... so use the blue pooper scooper, and watch your step. Don't worry about the color. He likes mangoes. Marley is not allowed to drink out of the toilet... so be sure to keep the lid closed... and the brick on the lid. You know, actually, you might want... to just keep the bathroom door shut in general. Like most dogs, Marley needs a lot of exercise... so try to take him for a walk or a run every morning and every evening. Marley, let go! Let go. Let go. Let go. Aaah! Marley, no! And be sure to lock the doors and windows before you go to sleep. Shoo! Shoo! But don't worry. Marley is an excellent watchdog. You can rest easy at night knowing he's on the job. Thunderstorms are his weak point. You can give him sedatives if you think a storm is arriving. Okay. Here you go. Marley. Marley, come back here. He doesn't like them, so push them down his throat as far as they go. Welcome. Welcome. I'm Mrs. Butterly. Now finally, we do not allow Marley to get up on any piece of furniture... chew on anything except his toys. Other than that, enjoy him. Love, Jenny and John.

For now, he's good. The problem is that once this happens, it almost always happens again. And if it does, I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do for him. He's an older dog. I honestly don't think he would survive the surgery. Well, we have to make sure that doesn't happen again. Well, most likely, it is gonna happen again. Well, we also talked about that maybe he ate too fast or drank too quickly. Right. So maybe it doesn't have to happen again. We'll monitor that. I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself that he may not make it through the night. Maybe 10%% of dogs survive this kind of a thing. WhatWhat is that number based on? What is it based on? Yeah, the reason why I ask... is I bet that number's based on regular dogs. Regular dogs? Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs. I know people probably say that all the time, but to be honest... I'm not sure he really is a dog. He once ate an answering machine. Just polished it off. He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested it. Then went and had the phone for dessert. Another time, my son had colic and this guy sat up all night, didn't move... just stayed right there for nine hours just keeping an eye on Conor. So I think maybe that the number applies to regular dogs. But not to him. Well, you got a fighter here. Let's hope for the best. I know he's gonna be okay. I'll see you in the morning.;1;8178;8351;0

We don't exactly know why this happens. Most likely he ate or drank something quickly and his stomach just flipped. I did manage to get a tube down there to relieve some of the gas. I think I untwisted it. He seems okay. For now, he's good. The problem is that once this happens, it almost always happens again. And if it does, I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do for him. He's an older dog. I honestly don't think he would survive the surgery. Well, we have to make sure that doesn't happen again. Well, most likely, it is gonna happen again. Well, we also talked about that maybe he ate too fast or drank too quickly. Right. So maybe it doesn't have to happen again. We'll monitor that. I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself that he may not make it through the night. Maybe 10%% of dogs survive this kind of a thing. WhatWhat is that number based on? What is it based on? Yeah, the reason why I ask... is I bet that number's based on regular dogs. Regular dogs? Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs. I know people probably say that all the time, but to be honest... I'm not sure he really is a dog. He once ate an answering machine. Just polished it off. He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested it. Then went and had the phone for dessert. Another time, my son had colic and this guy sat up all night, didn't move... just stayed right there for nine hours just keeping an eye on Conor. So I think maybe that the number applies to regular dogs. But not to him. Well, you got a fighter here. Let's hope for the best. I know he's gonna be okay. I'll see you in the morning. Oh, hi. Hey.

Madam Secretary, we lost contact with one of our D.S.C.S.3 listening satellites... orbiting Earth. What is that image? Are you saying the sphere in Central Park isn't the only one? In fact, we have intelligence... that smaller spheres have landed at other locations around the world. Do we have briefings on that? And where are these spheres right now? How is that even possible? I think we're asking the wrong questions. What questions should we be asking? Well, let's start with this. Where is our satellite? We lost contact with it. In the scheme of things, the loss of one satellite isn't necessarily our concern. D.S.C.S.3 stands for Defense Systems Communications Satellite. Remember what it communicates with? They were able to access our defense mainframe via that satellite. That's how they temporarily shut down our missile defenses and entered our airspace. We have changed all the codes. And on top of that, there is a vast amount of vital intelligence on that mainframe. They know everything about us now. And we know nothing about them. Almost nothing. The fact that they chose to disable our defenses tells us... something about their intentions.;0;2617;2719;0

This is our chief geneticist, Dr. Hideo Ikegawa. This is our chief astrobiologist, Dr. Helen Benson. Hello. Doctor? The being is in a nascent state. The D.N.A. samples we've taken seem to represent three distinct life forms. Three different D.N.A. types? Yes, including the being's brain. The body tissue is human, as far as we can tell. The gray flesh encasing it is organic material. Some kind of bioengineered space suit. What it resembles, oddly enough, is placental tissue. Which makes sense, given that placenta's a lifesupport system. And that basically, in order to survive in our environment, the being had to be born here... in its human form. They must've come here in the past and obtained a D.N.A. sample from a human subject. Now, since that birth, the being has grown exponentially. This is one hour after surgery. Three hours. Six hours. How much can you tell us about it... by decoding its D.N.A.? Um, you don't understand. These are the Dead Sea Scrolls. Geneticists... are gonna be studying this code for generations. No, they aren't.

I've been sent here to determine who or what you represent... and what your intentions are. It feels unreal to me. Alien. It'll take time to adapt. What were you... before you were human? Different. Different how? It would only frighten you. Do you have a name? Klaatu. Do you represent a civilization? I represent a group of civilizations. Where is this group of civilizations? All around you. What is your purpose in coming here? There is a gathering of world leaders not far from here. I will explain my purpose to them. I'm afraid that's not possible. Perhaps you should explain yourself to me instead. Do you speak for the entire human race? I speak for the president of the United States. Now, please, tell me. Why have you come to our planet? Your planet? Yes. This is our planet. No. It is not. We've decided to sedate him and move him to a more secure location. Are you going to interrogate him? That's a possibility. Madam Secretary, as scientists, we can't consent to this. He says he wants to speak to the U.N. History has lessons to teach us about first encounters... between civilizations. As a rule, the lessadvanced civilization is either exterminated or enslaved. I'm thinking of Pizarro and the Incas, Columbus and the Native Americans, and the list goes on.

The object is moving at speeds of up to three times 10 to the seventh meters per second. At first, it was projected to pass millions of miles outside of Earth's orbit. However, we soon discovered that... the object was not following a gravitationally free fall trajectory. As such, its path was recalculated. It was at this time a crisis response team was activated... and everything you see around you was set in motion. Can we launch a missile to intercept it? The military's attempting to do just that. In fact, they may launch several. But given the speed at which this object is moving, our chances of success are slim at best. Why don't they evacuate the area? We simply do not have enough time.

Until this situation has some kind of resolve, I am the eyes and the ears of the presidency. So, what do we know? Madam Secretary, we lost contact with one of our D.S.C.S.3 listening satellites... orbiting Earth. What is that image? Are you saying the sphere in Central Park isn't the only one? In fact, we have intelligence... that smaller spheres have landed at other locations around the world. Do we have briefings on that? And where are these spheres right now? How is that even possible? I think we're asking the wrong questions. What questions should we be asking? Well, let's start with this. Where is our satellite? We lost contact with it. In the scheme of things, the loss of one satellite isn't necessarily our concern. D.S.C.S.3 stands for Defense Systems Communications Satellite. Remember what it communicates with? They were able to access our defense mainframe via that satellite. That's how they temporarily shut down our missile defenses and entered our airspace. We have changed all the codes. And on top of that, there is a vast amount of vital intelligence on that mainframe. They know everything about us now. And we know nothing about them. Almost nothing. The fact that they chose to disable our defenses tells us... something about their intentions.;0;2617;2717;0

This is our chief geneticist, Dr. Hideo Ikegawa. This is our chief astrobiologist, Dr. Helen Benson. Hello. Doctor? The being is in a nascent state. The D.N.A. samples we've taken seem to represent three distinct life forms. Three different D.N.A. types? Yes, including the being's brain. The body tissue is human, as far as we can tell. The gray flesh encasing it is organic material. Some kind of bioengineered space suit. What it resembles, oddly enough, is placental tissue. Which makes sense, given that placenta's a lifesupport system. And that basically, in order to survive in our environment, the being had to be born here... in its human form. They must've come here in the past and obtained a D.N.A. sample from a human subject. Now, since that birth, the being has grown exponentially. This is one hour after surgery. Three hours. Six hours. How much can you tell us about it... by decoding its D.N.A.? Um, you don't understand. These are the Dead Sea Scrolls. Geneticists... are gonna be studying this code for generations. No, they aren't.

Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. That's a feeling.;0;5850;6108;0

It's all ruined. No, Dad! It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined! No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't! It's all ruined, you little fucking shit! No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad! You loser! You loser! I'm not a loser. You fucking loser! You ruined everything! He was defending his brother! You fucking idiot! You spike the ball on the one yard line, Who is this?! Who's this?! We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up! Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called..., but I tried to call you, Tiffany, I Oh, really? Yes. I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way. What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell? There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation! She's fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here. You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you? Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since You think that I'm why today's happened? That's right, you are why today happened. I'm the reason why today happened? I think so. Let's talk about that. Be my guest. The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twentysix. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS. She's right, Dad. The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty seven to fourteen. Wow. The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two. Oh, wow. Let me think about that. Wait a minute. Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven. He was with you? He was with me. We went for a run. Really? That's crazy. There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants. She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts. Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know? ""Excelsior. "" Look it up. Yeah, ""Excelsior. "" Oh Pat. Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is ""Excelsior, "" to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation. Unbelievable. Wow. How did you know all that stuff? I did my research. Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed. Thank you. I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do. Oh, now you like her, Dad? I have to say I do. Yup. Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil. Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years. Is that right? You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it! That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that! You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it. Yeah, prove it, prove it! How do you want me to prove it? How's he gonna prove it? By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying? Against the Cowboys. That's your team isn't it, Randy? That's his team! I know who his team is. When is the game? December twentyeight, last game of the season. Oh, my God. Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition. Oh God. Randy, I thought they were America's Team. Don't you believe in America's Team? Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team? Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing. I like it. No. No, Patrizio I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I'll take the action. I'll take it. Dad! Patrizio, don't! It's toxic! I have faith, I have faith. Excelsior belongs in this house Dad ... not in the State of New York. In this house. Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that ""Excelsior"" was the state motto of New York, okay? I didn't know, either, but now I know. I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing Randy, what do you say... Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough. Randy, what do you say? My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points. I'll give you three more. Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet! In fact, I'll give you ten points. No, Dad! Dad! Dad! You have to take that bet on the Cowboys. Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus! How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. What's that? Tiffany, what's that? What? No, no, no, no. You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay. What? No parlay! No! No, don't do it. Don't do it. Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything? I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores. Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good? We suck. We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there. And how are the people you're competing against? They're good. Some of them are professionals. They're good? Better than you? A lot better. A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right? No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break! We can't get five! Give 'em a five. Give 'em a five. We can do a five. What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance! That's the parlay. Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please? You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance. That's very, very manic indeed. That's the parlay. Shake on it. You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. Randy, Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out. Pat, you can't quit. I'm not doing the dance. I'm out. Pat, calm down. Thank about it. See you later. Pat, no. What are you doing? Pat. I'm out. Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go. What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on... I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry. You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs... if it's me reading the signs If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay. Pat! You are not a stand up guy! Pat! I told you not to push it. Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing. He can't be a quitter. He cannot be a quitter. You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it. There's only one way to get him to show. What's that? Oh, what's that?

The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, 'cause I should have. I come home, what do I see?

Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true... It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh... ...undiagnosed bipolar. Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been whiteknuckling it this whole time. That had to be hard. Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of. Pat, you have to take your medication. I can't, Mom. I can't. I will call them.

Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something. Does Nikki still work here? You know I can't tell you that. But Doug Culpepper is still here. Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What, are you being, a troublemaker? You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight? I did, yeah. I did. Thank you. Get away from me! Get away! I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay? I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are. I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay? You just have to give it some time. Yes. You know, a lot went down. People will get over it. It'll be all good. It'll work out. Yes! It will be! I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy! A silver development! That's a silver lining! Good luck. Ronnie! Pat. There he is! He's back! Hey. Welcome home. Thank you. Welcome back, man. Yeah, I'm out. Yeah? You're out out? Uhhuh. Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight. I almost didn't recognize you. Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work's out of control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back. I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby. She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you. Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation. 'Cause you think Veronica still hates you? I know Veronica still hates me. That's not true. Yes, it is. Nikki always said that ""Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse. "" That's not true. Ronnie! What are you doing? Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner? Hmm? Did you invite him? Yes. Well, can he make it? I don't know yet! Can you make it next Sunday? Sure. I'll see you next Sunday. Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? Does Veronica still talk to Nikki? Yeah. Get in here, please. I need you. Okay. As soon as you left, the Redskins threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El. Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging it, loses the challenge, loses the game. You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do. And we should spend time together anyway. I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please. I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news. What's that? What's the good news? Things are looking up. Oh, are they? You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it. Listen, she might be with that guy. That, the... Oh, no way! She..., no, she might be with him. She's afraid of you. She doesn't want to talk to you. No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper? Put the phone down. You gotta... Wait just a minute. ...Put the phone down, please. What are you doing? Listen..., stop. Pat! You gotta understand me. You wanna go back? Well then, stop this! Then don't fucking do this. Don't talk to me like that. Well then, don't behave this way. I got... a call asking to... ...check on this house. Pat Solatano? Yeah. Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay? Five hundred feet. You hear what he just said? Youhave a restraining order. Yeah, Dad, I know. Thank you, Officer. If you need anything... my card. Thank you. Sorry. We understand. Since when do cops have cards? Tell me one thing. Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your medication and if you do fine, we'll reduce them. Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication. Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one. Let me say something, I gotta say something. Okay. This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining. Work on a strategy, okay? Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoitytoity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles. Which jersey? DeSean Jackson. DeSean Jackson is the man. Well, that settles that. Pat! What are you doin'? I gotta go, man. Why? I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this. Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. I wish I was wearing that jersey. I feel like an idiot. Are you comfortable? Veronica's not gonna like it. Get over here. Plus you got a tie on. Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come. Really? Get over here. DeSean Jackson's in the house! You mean rookie of the year? Yeah. DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson? Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner. Isn't it awesome? Not for dinner. Look, he got us flowers. Oh, that's sweet. That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely. And wine. Hey. Hey. Check this out. We just redid the whole thing. Wow! Tremendous. Tremendous. Isn't it great? Tremendous. Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again. Why? Because. Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that. Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain. Isn't the market down, though? It is down, but you know, she wants more, so I'm giving her more, man. Hey, you know my dad lost his pension. I'm sorry, man. Yeah. A lot of people. My uncle, too. Really? Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect, it's not personal, but this is the time to strike. You start snapping up commercial real estate... cheap... flip it over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money. But the pressure... it's like... You okay? I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me. I feel like I'm getting crushed and Crushed by what? Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, you know, and, and, and I'm like... suffocating. Holy shit. You can't be happy all the time. Who told you you can't be happy? It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice. That's not true at all. You just can't. Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie! I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over. You okay with that? Who? Veronica's sister. Tiffany. Tiffany and... Tommy? Yeah. Just Tiffany. What happened to Tommy? He died. Tommy died?

Excelsior. Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay? No. Why? Because you have a restraining order. What good are you, man? Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night? Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months? Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you? Not bad, Doctor Jones.

And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, marriedtoadeadguy slut. Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her. She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same? Can you? Is that...?

He trusts you. He's not embarrassed? No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. 'Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole. Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet.

This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about 'Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it.

It is one of the worst times on record for America. This is our moment. Now, last summer, we received a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.;0;1790;1850;0

And she had some pretty big ideas that she challenged me with. And my first reaction was, ""Who does this kid think that she is?"" But after I gave it a listen, she really knocked me out. So... With a peek into our future, Natalie Keener. If there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this. Glocal? Glocal. Our global must become local. This company keeps 23 people on the road at least 250 days a year. It's expensive and it's inefficient When I came to Craig three months ago with this, he told me, and quite astutely, it's only a problem if you have a solution. Well, today I stand before you with just that. You all know Ned in reception. Today I'm gonna fire Ned. Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR will hire you back this afternoon. We'll see about that. Now Ned could be any employee in any one of our clients' locations worldwide. Strategy packets will be shipped in advance. Ned will be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting for him. Mr Laskin, the reason we're having this conversation is your position is no longer available. I don't understand. I'm fired? Hearing the words ""You've been let go"" is never easy. Change is always scary, but consider the following: anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it. That's my fucking line. But what happens now? This is the first step of a process that will end with you in a new job that fulfills you. Yeah, but how does it work? Take the packet in front of you. Review it all the answers you're looking for are inside. Start filling out the necessary information and before you know it you will be on your way to new opportunities. Now Ned, I need you to go back to your desk and start putting together your things. As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet. Panic doesn't help anyone. I understand. Give it up for Ned. You can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch, and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line. Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by 85%. And more importantly, to you guys on the road, no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa, no more hours lost to weather delays. You get to come home.";0;1850;2085;0

That's why I brought the entire company in from the road, because we're not taking it seriously. There is a methodology to what I do. There is a reason why it works. Coke and IBM have been doing this for years. Are you familiar with them? Like anything else, it'll take a few months to sort of transition and everybody will settle in. Who are you taking off the road? How are you not getting this? You are grounded. Everybody's grounded. It's done. What we do here is brutal and it does leave people devastated.

And I think you have some very good ideas. But you know nothing about the realities of my industry. You can set up an iChat, but you don't know how people think. Actually I minored in psychology. Nice. OK, kiddo, fire me. Ryan... If she's gonna do this regular basis, don't you wanna know if she can fire somebody? She's fired Ned. My dog can fire Ned. Fire me. You don't need to do this. No, it's OK. I got this. Mr Bingham, I regret to inform you that your position at this company is no longer available. Hm. Who the hell are you? My name is Miss Keener. I'm here today to discuss your future. My future? The only one who can fire me is Craig Gregory. Mr Gregory hired me to handle this for him. Handle what? Handle Me? Mr. Gregory hired me, he's the only one who can fire me. You know what? I'm gonna go talk to him. Mr Bingham... No, no, no. You can't follow me. You're on a computer screen, remember? Right. Let's try this again. Fire me again. I just did. Actually, you didn't. Fire me. That's enough. I think we get it. Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you your position is no longer available. I'm fired? Yes, you're fired. Never say fired. You've been let go. Why? This is a mythical situation. How could I possibly know why? Why doesn't matter, you never know why. It's important to not focus on the why, and rather, spend your energy thinking about your future. Well, I'm gonna spend my energy on suing you unless you give me a good reason why you're firing me. Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important. S you're firing me without grounds? Now I really have a lawsuit. I get what you're trying to say, Ryan. Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham. Personally? This is the most personal situation that you are ever gonna enter, so before you try to revolutionise my business, I'd like to know that you actually know my business.;1;2137;2312;0

Cheese this weekend or something? Not me. No, my kids, we're not gonna do anything. What do you suggest I tell them? Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect that your career transition can have on your children. The positive effect? I make about 90 grand a year now. Unemployment is what 250 bucks a week? Is that one of your positive effects? We'll get to be cosier cause I'm not gonna be able to pay my mortgage on my house. So maybe we can move into a nice fucking onebedroom apartment somewhere. And I guess without benefits, I'll be able to hold my daughter as she, you know, suffers from her asthma that I won't be able to afford the medication for. Well...tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically... ..as a method of coping. Go fuck yourself. That's what my kids will think.

I'm fired? Hearing the words ""You've been let go"" is never easy. Change is always scary, but consider the following: anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.

Start filling out the necessary information and before you know it you will be on your way to new opportunities. Now Ned, I need you to go back to your desk and start putting together your things. As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet. Panic doesn't help anyone. I understand. Give it up for Ned. You can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch, and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line. Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by 85%.

Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect that your career transition can have on your children. The positive effect? I make about 90 grand a year now. Unemployment is what 250 bucks a week? Is that one of your positive effects? We'll get to be cosier cause I'm not gonna be able to pay my mortgage on my house. So maybe we can move into a nice fucking onebedroom apartment somewhere. And I guess without benefits, I'll be able to hold my daughter as she, you know, suffers from her asthma that I won't be able to afford the medication for. Well...tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically... ..as a method of coping. Go fuck yourself. That's what my kids will think.

That can't possibly be true. It is. What would account for that? Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China, but here's my question. How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SATs? I didn't know they take SATs in China. They don't. I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me. You got a 1600? Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group, but I can't sing. Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong? I could row crew or invent a $25 PC. Or you could get into a final club. Or I get into a final club. You know, from a woman's perspective, sometimes not singing in an a Capella group is a good thing. This is serious. On the other hand, I do like guys who row crew. Well, I can't do that. I was kidding. And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test. Have you ever tried? I'm trying right now. To row crew? To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like, whatever, delusional? Maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once. I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at. But you've seen guys who row crew, right? No. Okay, well, they're bigger than me. They're worldclass athletes. And a second ago, you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you had met one. I guess I just meant I like the idea of it. You know, the way a girl likes cowboys. Okay. Should we get something to eat? Would you like to talk about something else? No. It's just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club, I think I may have missed a birthday. There are really more people in China with genius IQs than the entire population... The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc. Which one? The Porcellian, the Porc. It's the best of the best. Which Roosevelt? Theodore. Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party with the next Fed chairman? So you can see why it's so important to get in. Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into? Why would you ask me that? I was just asking. None of them. That's the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won't come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here. Must be nice. He made $300,000 in a summer? He likes meteorology. You said it was oil futures. You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance. I... What? You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance. The one that's the easiest to get into would be the one where anybody has the best chance. You didn't ask me which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest one. I was honestly just asking, okay? I was just asking to ask. Mark, I'm not speaking in code. Erica. You're obsessed with finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it who will prescribe you some sort of medication. You don't care if the side effects may include blindness. Final clubs. Not ""finals clubs."" And there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated. Yes. There is. Well, you do. That was cryptic, so you do speak in code. I didn't mean to be cryptic. I'm just saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs. Why? Because they're exclusive. And fun, and they lead to a better life. Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club. He was a member of the Porcellian, and yes, he did. Well, why don't you just concentrate on being the best you you can be? Did you really just say that? I was kidding. Just because something's trite doesn't make it less true. I wanna try to be straightforward with you and tell you I think you might want to be a little more supportive. If I get in, I will be taking you to the events and the gatherings, and you'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to meet. You would do that for me? We're dating. Okay. Well, I wanna try and be straightforward with you and let you know that we're not anymore. What do you mean? We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry. Is this a joke? No, it's not. You're breaking up with me? You're gonna introduce me to people I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet? What the... What is that supposed to mean? Wait, settle down. What is it supposed to mean? Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink right now is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy. ""The door guy""? His name is Bobby. I have not slept with the door guy. The door guy is a friend of mine, and he's a perfectly good class of people. And what part of Long Island are you from, Wimbledon? Wait. Wait, wait. I'm going back to my dorm. Is this real? Yes. Then wait, I apologize, okay? I have to go study. Erica? Yes? I'm sorry, I mean it. I appreciate that, but I have to go study. Come on, you don't have to study. Let's just talk. I can't. Why? Because it is exhausting. Dating you is like dating a StairMaster. All I meant is that you're not likely to... Currently... I wasn't making a comment on your appearance. I was saying that you go to BU. I was stating a fact, that's all, and if it seemed rude, then I apologize. I have to go study. You don't have to study. Why do you keep saying I don't have to study? 'Cause you go to BU. Do you want to get some food? I am sorry you are not sufficiently impressed with my education. And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat, so we're even. I think we should just be friends. I don't want friends. I was just being polite. I have no intention of being friends with you. I'm under some pressure right now from my OS class and if we could just order some food, I think we should... Okay, you are probably going to be a very successful computer person.

Nothing I can do about that. Dunster is intense. Not only is there no public directory, but there's no directory at all. You have to do searches, and if your search returns more than 20 matches, nothing gets returned. And once you do get results, they don't link directly to the images. They link to a PHP that redirects or something. Weird. This may be difficult. I'll come back later. Hey, Shark Week's on. What? Great white, beautiful fish. Nice. Leverett is a little better.

You can go in now. That's their own stupidity. I should've been there. Well, darkness is the absence of light, and the stupidity in that instance was the absence of me. Catherine, I've got students in my office now. Students. Undergrads. I don't know. From the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise. All right, byebye. Good morning. Good morning, sir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler. And you're here because... Either of you can answer. I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter. I've read the letter. Well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection... We've since changed the name to ConnectU. And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea... I understand. And I'm asking what you want me to do about it. Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman, under the heading ""Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,"" it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members in this community. Students are required to respect public and private ownership, and instances of theft, misappropriation or... Anne? Yes, sir? Punch me in the face. Go ahead. ...or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the college. And you memorized that instead of doing what? What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully, of course... Sir, it's against university rules to steal from another student, plain and simple. And you've spoken to your House Master? Yes, sir. And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board, but the Ad Board won't see us. Have you tried dealing with the other student directly? Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our emails or phone calls for the last two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland, and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square. You chased him? I saw him and I know he saw me. I went after him and then he disappeared. I don't see this as a university issue. Of course this is a university issue. There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both. You enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other. I'm sorry, President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all. I'm devastated by that. What my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer, that would be a university issue. I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny. This isn't petty larceny. This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars. Millions? Yes. You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you. Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call. I was the US Treasury Secretary. I'm in some position to make that call. Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshman address. Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project. You would? Yes. Everyone at Harvard's inventing something. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job. So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project. I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point. Please, arrive at the point. You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong. And you're saying that I don't? Of course I'm not saying that, sir. I'm saying that. Really? Sir. Anne, how did they get this appointment? Colleagues of their father. Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss, since you're on the subject of right and wrong. This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong. It's not worthy of Harvard. It's not what Harvard saw in you. You don't get special treatment. We never asked... Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for a science fair? If you have a problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss... We never asked for special treatment. ...the courts are always at your disposal. Is there anything else I can do for you? You can take the Harvard Student Handbook and shove it... Ty.

Tell me about the strategy you're using. Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas, but Baylor already had a social network on campus. So instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within 100 miles... You put The Facebook on those campuses first. Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw their friends on our site and we were in. It's called the Little Bighorn. That's smart, Mark. Thanks, that was mine. Easy. Hey, you know what? Settle an argument for us. I say it's time to start making money from The Facebook, but Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right? Well... Neither of you yet. The Facebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it. Yeah. You don't wanna ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool. Exactly. It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus and someone's saying it's gotta be over by 11:00. That's exactly right. You don't even know what the thing is yet. Exactly. How big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? You? ""A billion dollars."" And that shut everybody up. And that's where you're headed. A billiondollar valuation. Unless you take bad advice, in which case you may as well have come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

Yep. That's a good analogy. Okay. But we all know marlins don't really weigh 3,000 pounds, right? Have you seen the big ones up close? No, but I don't think the guy's holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover. That would be a really big fish and a very strong guy. You think we might be getting away from the point? I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm just a fan who came to say hi. He owned Mark after that dinner. He picked up the check, he told Mark they'd talk again soon, and he was gone.

Did he add anything else? Yes. It probably was a diversity thing. But so what? Why do you think he said that? Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, but whose discovery is this? Sy, if you'll let me continue with my line of questioning. What are you suggesting? That I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix and began a plan to screw him out of a company I hadn't even invented yet. Were you? Gretchen. Jealous of Eduardo? Stop typing.

He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys. ""These guys,"" meaning my clients. Yes. He resented... Mark resented that your clients thought that he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash. But Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash, he'd hacked into the Harvard computers, he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety. Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do.

I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg. I've never been in this building before. This building's 100 years older than the country it's in, so do be careful. We're sitting in chairs. Yes. Very good. You can go in now. That's their own stupidity. I should've been there. Well, darkness is the absence of light, and the stupidity in that instance was the absence of me. Catherine, I've got students in my office now. Students. Undergrads. I don't know. From the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise. All right, byebye. Good morning. Good morning, sir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler. And you're here because... Either of you can answer. I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter. I've read the letter. Well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection... We've since changed the name to ConnectU. And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea... I understand. And I'm asking what you want me to do about it. Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman, under the heading ""Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,"" it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members in this community. Students are required to respect public and private ownership, and instances of theft, misappropriation or... Anne? Yes, sir? Punch me in the face. Go ahead. ...or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the college. And you memorized that instead of doing what? What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully, of course... Sir, it's against university rules to steal from another student, plain and simple. And you've spoken to your House Master? Yes, sir. And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board, but the Ad Board won't see us. Have you tried dealing with the other student directly? Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our emails or phone calls for the last two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland, and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square. You chased him? I saw him and I know he saw me. I went after him and then he disappeared. I don't see this as a university issue. Of course this is a university issue. There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both. You enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other. I'm sorry, President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all. I'm devastated by that. What my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer, that would be a university issue. I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny. This isn't petty larceny. This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars. Millions? Yes. You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you. Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call. I was the US Treasury Secretary. I'm in some position to make that call. Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshman address. Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project. You would? Yes. Everyone at Harvard's inventing something. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job. So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project. I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point. Please, arrive at the point. You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong. And you're saying that I don't? Of course I'm not saying that, sir. I'm saying that. Really? Sir. Anne, how did they get this appointment? Colleagues of their father. Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss, since you're on the subject of right and wrong. This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong. It's not worthy of Harvard. It's not what Harvard saw in you. You don't get special treatment. We never asked... Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for a science fair? If you have a problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss... We never asked for special treatment. ...the courts are always at your disposal. Is there anything else I can do for you? You can take the Harvard Student Handbook and shove it... Ty.

He'd already told me that he wouldn't be coming back to school for at least a semester, so we were saying goodbye for a while. And then before I left he said... But you gotta come back. Somewhere around the end of November or early December. Peter wants to throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members. It's gonna be out of control. You gotta come back for it. A million members? Yeah. Remember the algorithm on the window at Kirkland? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be here. You sure about this? You're 20 minutes late.

What else did the email say? It said that we had to have a business meeting. That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity, and that Manningham was so impressed that he was now making an investment offer that was hard to turn down. So I went to California, and I went straight to the new offices. I didn't know whether to dress for the party or for the business meeting, so I kind of dressed for both. But it didn't matter. Why not? Because I wasn't called out there for either one. What were you called out there for? An ambush. Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here. Hey, man. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, good, good, good, good. Good to see you. At first I thought he was joking. Giving me more contracts to sign. But then I started reading. Wait, what is this? Well, as you know, we had some new investors that have come in. What is this? Mr. Saverin. Mark! Mark? He's wired in. Sorry? He's wired in. Is he? Yes. How about now? Are you still wired in? Call security. You issued 24 million new shares of stock! You were told that if new investors came along... How much were your shares diluted? How much were his? What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to? It wasn't. What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share diluted down to? It wasn't. What was Sean Parker's ownership share diluted down to? It wasn't. What was Peter Thiel's ownership share diluted down to? It wasn't. And what was your ownership share diluted down to? .03% You signed the papers. You set me up. You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company, and you made a bad business deal with your own company? It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook. It won't be like you're not a part of Facebook. You're not a part of Facebook. My name's on the masthead. You might wanna check again. This because I froze the account?

It won't work. Don't try to play it up. That won't work either. Mikael, can we get a quote? Mikael, will you appeal? Yes. I'll appeal to you, Viggo. Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim, the brave journalist going up against the bad guy. I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven. When you call a guy a criminal... If you want to say these things... Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity. There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel. ... was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel. Can I get that sandwich there? And a black coffee. In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed, WennerstrÃ¶m, founder and president of the WennerstrÃ¶m Group, used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland in an arms deal with the rightwing UstaÅ¡e in Croatia. I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a fine journalist, who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate. And inaccuracies can't go unanswered. All journalists have to accept, like the rest of us, actions have consequences. Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600,000 Swedish kronor in damages and all court costs.

Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it. She returned a little after 2:00. She came into the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. It was during those few minutes that something else occurred. The accident had nothing to do with Harriet, and yet everything. Heh. It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing. Police, ambulance, fire brigade, reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side. The driver of the car, a man named Aronsson, was pinned and severely injured. We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands since metal tools might spark. It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital. Just as we from our side slowly drifted back to the house. The sun was down, the excitement over. We sat down to dinner. It was then that I noticed. Harriet wasn't there.

Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her running the company one day. She was with some friends that day at a parade. She told them she was feeling unwell. She left early. But they also told me she kept secrets from them too. The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated. I have one. Oh, then you know. I wanted to, uh, ahem, ask you about this. She received that from Henrik the Christmas before. I've studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. It's the last page I was curious about. As was I. It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance. All local phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman, Margot, whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died some years before. The other three were not connected in any way that I could find. I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry. I can't forget. It's my Rebecka case. Uh, I don't know what that is. Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over.

It was clear I could manage my own finances. That is not clear to me. I'm not a child. You are not. But you were. And between then and now, you were committed to the locked ward of St. Stefan's where you continued to display violent aggression. And you failed to adapt to four foster homes, arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics, again for assault, smashing a bottle into a man's face. And it's not even that long ago.

He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager. You were the same age. My sister Anita was closer to her in age. She knew Harriet better than anyone. You should talk to her. I'd love to. Where is she? If I had to guess, London. You don't know where your sister lives? I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along. I'm getting used to that comment.

Well, I would be if I had any money. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. I haven't seen him in over 20 years. Actually, it's a lot more than that. Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family. Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid. I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question. Well, then let me narrow it down. I've gotten up to the 1960s, to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life. Harriet. Um, everything that I know about that, I told to whatever his name was. Morell. My recollections were a lot better then. I'm not really speaking about the event itself. I just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. She was very messed up. Well, just like all us Vanger kids, really, but... Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least her father wasn't a Nazi. Was he abusive? Mine? No, hers. Not that I ever saw, but you could tell that something was going on. Some days she'd be very withdrawn. And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school. And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun. No Vanger was ever religious. Can you imagine? She was obviously very unhappy. What do you think happened to her? Everyone knows what. You don't have any thoughts about who or why? All that I know is that I felt really sorry for her. I got away when I was 18 and I never went back. And she'd have done the same. But she never made it to 18. Mr. Bjurman, please.

So, what do you have to tell me? What's this? Hello, Henrik. I barely remember WennerstrÃ¶m working here, much less being fired. How could you? It was such a long time ago, which is kind of more to the point than the money he embezzled from you. You're referring to the statute of limitations, but I had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out. If I had, I never would've let him bring you up here. He wasn't trying to deceive you. He knows you can't try somebody 35 years after the event. I like Henrik, but he knows that. A man's reputation means something. He believes that. He thought you could destroy WennerstrÃ¶m in the court of public opinion. The court of public opinion celebrates people's bad behavior. He's an elderly man. He promised me WennerstrÃ¶m's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this. Yes, of course. What happened with WennerstrÃ¶m? How did he get you? I was stupid. I heard something. I got it from an anonymous source, who I'm now sure was one of WennerstrÃ¶m's lackeys. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court. You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about WennerstrÃ¶m? Go on. I did some work on my own on him before you hired me. I haven't looked at it all because you and HarrietfuckingVanger have kept me busy. But I may have something. You may have something? Maybe. They launder money from arms and drug sales and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings. The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. And how do you know this? This time you don't want to know. This time I do want to know. I have access to his computer, and his accountant's and lawyer's. And how do you have that? I could've gotten it from a source inside the company. You didn't. But that's what you'll say. And what will you say to me? Well, that depends if you really want to know. I do. Mikael, how did you get access? Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who, this time last year was convicted of libel In a Stockholm courtroom, doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes. Or maybe he has. In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the company that sued him, the WennerstrÃ¶m Group. The shit hits the fan. Of criminal activities on a global scale. What happens now? Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash. The police will investigate, Fl will investigate. It'll go to court. Maybe he'll go to prison. You think? Probably not. These guys never do. But here it comes at last And my heart Beats faster than safe What's wrong with you? It's embarrassing. Tell me. I need to borrow some money. Oh. Fifty thousand. I have a chance to make an investment. It's a smart, safe investment. I really don't think I've got 50,000. Yes, you do. You have 65,000 in your two accounts. I'm sorry that I know that. You'll get the money back, I promise. Okay. Okay. You want a coffee? These allegations, like the last one from this socalled journalist, are as ridiculous as they are untrue. I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again, and I'm looking forward to it. What about his documentation? Fabricated. All of it. The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. WennerstrÃ¶m of that. If a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist alleges proves to be true, not only will there be a securities investigation, but an organizedcrime inquiry as well. Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.

I'll appeal to you, Viggo. Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim, the brave journalist going up against the bad guy. I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven. When you call a guy a criminal... If you want to say these things... Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity. There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel. ... was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel. Can I get that sandwich there? And a black coffee. In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed, WennerstrÃ¶m, founder and president of the WennerstrÃ¶m Group, used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland in an arms deal with the rightwing UstaÅ¡e in Croatia. I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a fine journalist, who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate. And inaccuracies can't go unanswered. All journalists have to accept, like the rest of us, actions have consequences. Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600,000 Swedish kronor in damages and all court costs.

My brothers and their wives and their children and grandchildren were all gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade. Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it. She returned a little after 2:00. She came into the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. It was during those few minutes that something else occurred. The accident had nothing to do with Harriet, and yet everything. Heh. It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing. Police, ambulance, fire brigade, reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side. The driver of the car, a man named Aronsson, was pinned and severely injured. We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands since metal tools might spark. It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital. Just as we from our side slowly drifted back to the house. The sun was down, the excitement over. We sat down to dinner. It was then that I noticed. Harriet wasn't there. And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next 40 years. What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen? And she couldn't have just run away? No. Not without being seen. The firemen stayed out all night on the bridge pumping up gasoline. No one swam across or took a boat. All the boats were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, I checked. She couldn't have just fallen and drowned? No. The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls in the water turns up. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than 10 meters when he drowned the year before. Oh, no. Someone killed her. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. Those are from her. And the rest, from her killer. Who knows about these?

Bit of trouble, I guess. No jail time though. That's good. No. Cost you a lot of money though, yeah? There. The entire island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi, if you can believe. Two in the family. Oh, yes, he's quite detestable, to put it nicely. But you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse. He was there that day? Indeed, he was. His daughter, Cecilia, lives over there. They don't speak. Does anybody speak to anybody on this island? Ha, ha. Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother, who lives there, she speaks to Harald, which is one of the reasons I don't speak to her. Right. Cecilia's brother, Birger, lives over there. Who doesn't he speak to? You, probably. But you wouldn't want him to. He can be just as unpleasant as Harald. Quickly losing track of who's who here. Hohoho. How you'll wish it were always so. Soon you will know us all only too well, with my apologies. Now, out there, my grandnephew Martin's house, Harriet's brother. Who speaks to him? I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you. Oh. Someone's shooting his dinner. Gunnar, probably. Oh, yes, I met him earlier. He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. Well, he lives over there. And you live there. Sorry? Your house. Oh. Ha. Oh, yes. Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list.;0;2552;2897;0

But neither could I find the motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated? Did she know something someone wished she didn't? Was it about business? Business? Well, she was 16. And very bright. Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her running the company one day. She was with some friends that day at a parade. She told them she was feeling unwell. She left early. But they also told me she kept secrets from them too. The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated. I have one. Oh, then you know. I wanted to, uh, ahem, ask you about this. She received that from Henrik the Christmas before. I've studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. It's the last page I was curious about. As was I. It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance. All local phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman, Margot, whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died some years before. The other three were not connected in any way that I could find. I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry. I can't forget. It's my Rebecka case. Uh, I don't know what that is. Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over. Back then we had an Officer Torstensson. Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case. Taking out the files, studying them over and over. We were young. We laughed at him. And that was also a missinggirl case? No, no, no, that's not why I mention it. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor old Torstensson never solved it. And he never let it go.

You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking that you have changed, but when I'm looking at this, not to mention the way you're looking at me now, I don't think you have. So the good old Mr .

He was my age back then. He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager. You were the same age. My sister Anita was closer to her in age. She knew Harriet better than anyone. You should talk to her. I'd love to. Where is she? If I had to guess, London. You don't know where your sister lives? I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along.

Well, then let me narrow it down. I've gotten up to the 1960s, to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life. Harriet. Um, everything that I know about that, I told to whatever his name was. Morell. My recollections were a lot better then. I'm not really speaking about the event itself.

Ladies and gentlemen, Robbie Weaver. Whoo! Robbie! Welcome, class of 2011. Our time as middle schoolers has come to an end. We can't fight it anymore. We're getting old. All my life I wanted to grow up. I wanted to grow older so people would take me seriously. It all sounded so good to me. Growing up, getting a job, getting married. But... ...it's all a scam. And love? That's the biggest scam of all. I was in love. And I know that makes some of you laugh because I'm only 13... ...but whatever. I was. And I used to think, and really believe... ...that there was one true love for everyone... ...and if you fought hard enough for that person... ...your one true love would always work out. It sounded good to me when I was younger, but it just doesn't work that way. There is no such thing as one true love... Stop. Shit. Oh, boy. Okay. All right. Ahem. Excuse me.;0;9225;9422;0

There's no such thing as... I, uh... Um... Oh. Well, here's the thing: My son's graduation speech sucks. That's not a joke. In fairness, I didn't know where he was going with that. But I think we can all agree... ...it was headed in a kind of depressing, um, way. My son... Not him, my actual son. Believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes in the existence... ...of one's soul mate. And it's easy to just look at a 13yearold and say: ""You don't know what you're talking about. You are wrong. "" But I'm not so sure. I met my soul mate when I was 15 years old. We went out for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my first date, the way dads do. And I told him, ""Dad, it's no big deal. I'm gonna be going out with a lot of different girls on a lot of different dates. "" And that is the first time that I ever lied to my father. I met my soul mate when I was 15 years old... ...and I have loved her every minute of every day... ...since I first bought her that mint chocolate chip cone. I have loved her through the birth of my three perfect children. I have loved her even when I've hated her. Only married couples will understand that one. And I don't know if it's gonna work out. I don't know what's gonna happen. I'm sorry, Robbie, I can't give you that. But I can promise you this: I will never stop trying. Because when you find the one... ...you never give up.

Initial reports look like you pulled some kind of move up there, man. You saved a lot of lives. How many? The 102 souls on board, including the flight crew, 96 of them survived the crash. Six people died. Two crew, four passengers. Who on the crew? Listen, the protocol is... Who on the crew, Charlie? The protocol is that the NTSB has to be the first to make contact with you. I can't... And that agent's here, so let me go get him. It's a bit of a show. So, just... There's half a dozen of them. All right? Hey, Craig, come on in. Captain William Whitaker? Nod if you can hear me and understand me. I'm Craig Matson from the NT... NTSB. And I am required as the lead on the Go Team to make initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today. You are in a hospital in South Atlanta. Are you aware that the plane you were piloting went down? I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation. I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is you're in good condition. You did suffer a concussion, you have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to keep the patch on for a few days. Just as a precaution. Your eye seems to be okay. Now, the MRIs show that you have some strained tendons in your left knee and ankle, and you have no broken bones. But you have some deep bruising in your left thigh and some torn ligaments in your left wrist. Nothing serious. So, as soon as we clear your concussion and you feel well enough, you can go home. That may take a day, maybe three. Okay? I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact. How much do you remember about the flight? I remember... I remember everything up till the crash. Okay. Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life. The current information states that of the 102 souls on board, we lost six. Two crew members and four passengers. Fiftynine people were treated and released, 37 people remain... Who did we lose on the crew? The two flight attendants, Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. The rep from your pilots' union, Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you. It's important that you follow your union's guidance on press and media. The pilots' union works closely with the NTSB. So, I'm going to head out. I'll turn this off. Good luck, Mr. Whitaker. Thank you. I knew Trina Marquez. She was... We spent some time together. Yeah, apparently, she wasn't strapped in. A survivor reported she was assisting a kid. Margaret Thomason, how's she doing? Broken collarbone, just, I mean, cuts. I mean, she's banged up, but she's... She's here, too. She's fine. And Ken Evans, your copilot, he took a bad shot to the head. And they're keeping him in a coma just to let the brain swelling go down, but we feel good about him. He's going to be okay. What are you doing here, Charlie? I'm flying a desk now. I'm a rep for the pilots' union. You're the rep for the pilots' union? Yeah, I'm one of them. When your plane went down, all the reps got a page and I just shot up my hand, 'cause I know you, said I wanted to come be the first face you'd see. I'm glad you're here. The union's gonna release a statement on your behalf, condolences to the families who lost loved ones, gratitude to the brave men and women of the flight crew. That's... You don't have to worry about that. And I know you and Deana have been divorced for a while now, but maybe she and your son, Will, wanna... Yeah, Knuckles... How old is he now? Too old. Fifteen. Fifteen? Wow. Yeah. When we were flying for Delta, you weren't even married. We're dinosaurs, Whip. Do you want me to reach out to Deana? And see if she and Will want to come down... No, no. I'll... I'll call them. All right. Well, speaking of which, I got your phone. And a whole bunch of other personal effects from the plane. Your clothes are toast. Do you... Do you need me to get you some stuff, or... I'm okay. Charlie, I'm... I'm glad you came. Me, too. I'm happy to be here. All right, well, I'm going to... I'll let you get some rest. But I'll come back. I mean, you're going to see plenty of me. I'm sure you will. The plane was fucked, Charlie. It was doomed. I know.

Len's the president of the pilots' union. He wanted to be here to meet with us and you, but they need him at the crash site.

Six dead on that plane, someone has to pay. Yeah, but that's a plane that fell apart at... Thank you. Fell apart at 30,000 feet. The airline will try to prove equipment failure, which is gonna make the manufacturer responsible. The manufacturer in turn is gonna try and prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline. Or pilot error. I flew the plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh. You get the picture? A hundred people, upside down, 500 feet off the ground. Do you have any idea what that's like? I do. I heard the black box recordings last night. Oh, you heard. Are you a pilot? No, I'm not. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, do you? Hugh's on our team, Whip. Is he? Yeah, he is. He doesn't act like he's on our team. Well, he is. Asking me questions about fucking pilot error. Listen, it's the NTSB's ball game. They run the investigation. And they will ultimately rule on the cause. And that's why we need him. Well, they interview the entire flight crew. They interview the passengers. They hold public hearings. All right, let's cut to the chase. Just tell me what it is I need to know, Charlie. The NTSB Go Team also collects blood, hair and skin samples from the entire flight crew for the purposes of a toxicology report. Okay. When do they want to do that? They've already done that. In the hospital. It's the first thing they do. You don't remember having your blood drawn the night of the crash? No. No. They get the results of this test? Yeah, they do. Anything else for you gentlemen? Yeah. You had warm cinnamon buns over there, right? Yes, sir. Could you get me one of those, please? Sure. In fact, get me two of them. Yes, sir. Coming up. Thank you, sweetie. Now, an initial report shows that you had alcohol in your system at a level of .24. Now in the good old U.S. of A., one of the most lenient drunk driving countries in the world, you go to jail for driving with anything above .08. And by driving, I mean a car. Thank you. So... That doesn't mean anything. I had a couple of beers the night before the flight. That made the tail of the plane explode? A couple of beers? Yeah, a couple of beers. You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie. Hugh is your lawyer. I need a bigger lawyer. I need a lawyer that understands that someone put me in a broken plane. Without me up there, there would have been 102 funerals, not six. We're not talking about funerals right now, Captain. Well, then what are we talking about? We're talking about prison time. What? Lawsuits. Somebody has to pay. What, write a check? It's not gonna be me, I promise you that. As long as they're writing checks, tell them to write one for me, too. Because someone put me in a broken plane. I'd love a check, Charlie. This toxicology report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine. Felonies punishable by up to 12 years in prison. And if it is proven that your intoxication was the cause of the death of the four passengers, now we're gonna look at four counts of manslaughter. That could be life in prison. Now can I please do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report? He's gonna get it done, Whip. He'll get it done. It's what his whole life's about. Trust me. Trust him. You don't have to worry, you'll walk away from this the hero. I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise you that I'm not worried. No one could have landed that plane like I did. No one. Thanks for coming.

What does the union plan to do about this blood test saying Whitaker was high on booze and coke? This guy's a real peach. I'm going to kill the toxicology report. The testing was done incompetently. The toxicology equipment they used was last calibrated in June of 2009. It's already 18 months past code. Their log, that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials, and when, is very incomplete. And they used a preservative in the blood that has been known to cause fermentation, and in some cases, register higher in an alcohol test. Now, I've done all this, I've only been here a few days, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. I can handle this. I like this guy, Lenny. Makes me want to go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet. Mr. Carr, we're going to fight to push all the fault onto the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield. And you think they're gonna just open their checkbook and buy us all lunch? Good fucking luck. What's my exposure, Jim? Well, the awards to the families could kill the airline. Fuck the airline. The insurance companies can have the goddamn airline. I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets. Speaking for the pilots' union, sir, we don't want to see your airline go away. We enjoy the contract you have with us. We're gonna protect Captain Whitaker, and in turn, we're gonna protect your airline. Does Whitaker know he's going to jail? My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr. He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail. The only question is, is he going to die in jail? You're wrong, Mr. Carr. Last time I checked, six counts of manslaughter is life in prison. Life in prison. What we in Georgia call ""all day long.""";0;6013;6298;0

Remember, if they ask you anything about your drinking, ""it's totally acceptable to say, ""I don't recall."" Hey, don't tell me how to lie about my drinking, okay? I know how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, hearing officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning. Morning. What that video captures is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4,800 feet per minute in what is considered a ""full pitch nose down"" attitude. Then, at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created an animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. We're going to roll it. What do you mean ""Roll it""? We gotta do something to stop this dive. Margaret, what's your son's name? Trevor. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" What? Black box. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" I love you, Trevor. You be a good boy. Mommy loves you. Okay, here we go. I've got control. Oh, Lord Jesus! Flaps. Flaps! Speed brakes. Speed brakes! Margaret! Power! Gear up. Gear up! Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted! We're flying. We're level. We can maintain altitude like... Atlanta Center... SouthJet... 7. We are inverted. I... We are inverted. SouthJet 2... 7, did you say inverted? That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment on board flight 227, wherein you say, ""We're going to roll it."" ""Here we go. I've got control."" You made a very conscious decision to invert the aircraft, to roll the plane upside down, is that correct? I'm not sure if it was conscious. But... It was more like instinct. What led to that decision? I don't recall. Let me quote from an investigative summary. ""From 9:34 until 9:42, ""the events on the aircraft are,"" again I quote, ""bold and remarkable."" ""By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent"" ""and allowed the aircraft to level off,"" ""enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas"" ""and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field."" I heard a loud metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control. Yes. First Officer Evans' testimony confirms the same. I want to show you something. Nothing's happening. This remote isn't working. Apologies. I can do this manually. This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly that articulates the horizontal stabilizer, also known as the elevator. As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone. This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2011. It was never replaced. It had an additional 1,200 hours of flight on it. It finally failed. Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position, which forced the plane into a dive. The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, ""A catastrophic event from which recovery was improbable"" ""and stable flight impossible."" Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about the days leading and the hours leading up to the accident. But before I do, I want to remind you that you are under oath and that any testimony you give here today will be considered admissible in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings. Do you understand what that means? Captain Whitaker, for the record, I need you to verbalize your answer. I'm sorry. Yes, I understand. On the three days leading up to the accident, Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th, did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements? No, I did not. On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job? No, I did not. Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction? No. Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done. Due to the severe turbulence in the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane, is that correct? Yes, that's correct. I suspended the drink service on the plane. Are you aware that our investigators found two single service vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? Yes, I'm aware of that. There were five crew members on board that would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of these crew members, yourself, First Officer Evans, Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason, and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. Toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons, and one tested positive for alcohol. It registered a .17 blood alcohol level. Are you aware of that? Yeah, I'm aware of it now. Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work, is that correct? Outside of work? No, not really. Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem? No, I did not. Did you ever see her drink to excess? No, I did not. Were you aware that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines. No, I did not. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? Could you repeat the question? Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? I'm sorry, my what? Your opinion, Captain. Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissible in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those two bottles of vodka on the plane? God help me. I'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't hear you. What did you say? I said, ""God help me."" Yes, well, however, is it your opinion... It's my opinion. Trina did not drink that vodka. Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker? She saved the boy's life, that's... Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker? Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka because I drank the vodka. What the hell? Objection! Please be seated, sir. Sir. Captain Whitaker misspoke. I drank the vodka bottles. Didn't you hear me? I said I object! Please be seated, sir. This is not a courtroom. Well, I object anyway! I drank the vodka bottles on the plane. Captain Whitaker, on the three nights before the accident, October 11th... October 11th, October 12th, and 13th and 14th, I was intoxicated. I drank all of those days. I drank. In excess. On the morning of the accident... I was drunk. I'm drunk now. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block. Because I'm an alcoholic. That was it. I was finished. I was done. It was as if I had reached my lifelong limit of lies. I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker, 'cause if I had told just one more lie, I could have walked away from all that mess and kept my wings, kept my false sense of pride. And more importantly, I could have avoided being locked up in here with all you nice folks for the last 13 months. But I'm here. And I'll be here for at least the next four or five years. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's how the judge explained it to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA, they took away my pilot's license. And that's fair. My chances of ever flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. I've had a lot of time to think about it, all of it. I've been doing some writing. I wrote letters to each of the families that had lost loved ones. Some of them were able to hear my apology. Some of them never will. I also apologized to all the people that tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen. People like my wife, you know. My exwife and my son. And again, like I said, you know, some of them will never forgive me. Some of them will. But at least I'm sober. I thank God for that. I'm grateful for that. And this is going to sound real stupid coming from a man who's locked up in prison, but for the first time in my life, I'm free.";0;10285;11647;0

Somebody give me a hand here! Oh, my God! Charlie Anderson? Hey. Hey. How you feeling, Whip? Initial reports look like you pulled some kind of move up there, man. You saved a lot of lives. How many? The 102 souls on board, including the flight crew, 96 of them survived the crash. Six people died. Two crew, four passengers. Who on the crew? Listen, the protocol is... Who on the crew, Charlie? The protocol is that the NTSB has to be the first to make contact with you. I can't... And that agent's here, so let me go get him. It's a bit of a show. So, just... There's half a dozen of them. All right? Hey, Craig, come on in. Captain William Whitaker? Nod if you can hear me and understand me. I'm Craig Matson from the NT... NTSB. And I am required as the lead on the Go Team to make initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today. You are in a hospital in South Atlanta. Are you aware that the plane you were piloting went down? I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation. I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is you're in good condition. You did suffer a concussion, you have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to keep the patch on for a few days. Just as a precaution. Your eye seems to be okay. Now, the MRIs show that you have some strained tendons in your left knee and ankle, and you have no broken bones. But you have some deep bruising in your left thigh and some torn ligaments in your left wrist. Nothing serious. So, as soon as we clear your concussion and you feel well enough, you can go home. That may take a day, maybe three. Okay? I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact. How much do you remember about the flight? I remember... I remember everything up till the crash. Okay. Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life. The current information states that of the 102 souls on board, we lost six. Two crew members and four passengers. Fiftynine people were treated and released, 37 people remain... Who did we lose on the crew? The two flight attendants, Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. The rep from your pilots' union, Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you. It's important that you follow your union's guidance on press and media. The pilots' union works closely with the NTSB. So, I'm going to head out. I'll turn this off. Good luck, Mr. Whitaker. Thank you. I knew Trina Marquez. She was... We spent some time together. Yeah, apparently, she wasn't strapped in. A survivor reported she was assisting a kid. Margaret Thomason, how's she doing? Broken collarbone, just, I mean, cuts. I mean, she's banged up, but she's... She's here, too. She's fine. And Ken Evans, your copilot, he took a bad shot to the head. And they're keeping him in a coma just to let the brain swelling go down, but we feel good about him. He's going to be okay. What are you doing here, Charlie? I'm flying a desk now. I'm a rep for the pilots' union. You're the rep for the pilots' union? Yeah, I'm one of them. When your plane went down, all the reps got a page and I just shot up my hand, 'cause I know you, said I wanted to come be the first face you'd see. I'm glad you're here. The union's gonna release a statement on your behalf, condolences to the families who lost loved ones, gratitude to the brave men and women of the flight crew. That's... You don't have to worry about that. And I know you and Deana have been divorced for a while now, but maybe she and your son, Will, wanna... Yeah, Knuckles... How old is he now? Too old. Fifteen. Fifteen? Wow. Yeah. When we were flying for Delta, you weren't even married. We're dinosaurs, Whip. Do you want me to reach out to Deana? And see if she and Will want to come down... No, no. I'll... I'll call them. All right. Well, speaking of which, I got your phone. And a whole bunch of other personal effects from the plane. Your clothes are toast. Do you... Do you need me to get you some stuff, or... I'm okay. Charlie, I'm... I'm glad you came. Me, too. I'm happy to be here. All right, well, I'm going to... I'll let you get some rest. But I'll come back. I mean, you're going to see plenty of me. I'm sure you will. The plane was fucked, Charlie. It was doomed. I know. And the way you landed that plane was nothing short of a miracle. Know that. Okay, man? All right, cowboy. God. Damn. God damn it.;0;1992;3151;0

We'd like... This is the NBC affiliate in Athens. We're looking to... In the wake of the deadly crash of SouthJet flight 227, we have more questions than answers as to what exactly happened that day. And like many, we are out looking for answers. Looking here at the home of pilot Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker. We still have no sighting and no comments from the Captain himself. This is Mark Mellon, still on the hunt, from midtown Atlanta. You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides. Please leave a message and it will be returned. Thank you. Hey, cowboy. It's Charlie again. Listen, I'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight, but they said you'd gone home, so you must be feeling pretty good. Listen, I went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned, so you may be with relatives, which I understand, but I know you have a doctor's appointment early in the morning for your eye, and I was just hoping that you could meet us for breakfast. About 10:00 at the St. Regis, there's an executive buffet there. And we'll be covering some pretty important stuff, so it'd be nice to have you there. All right. Be good. Oh, there he is. Hey, Whip. Hey, buddy. Man, you look good. I feel good. Thanks for coming. Glad you got my message. How's your eye? Good, good. This is Hugh Lang, he's an attorney from Chicago. Pleasure to meet you, Captain. My pleasure. Sit down. You want a coffee? Yes, I do. Could we have some fresh coffee? Yes, sir. We were just talking about your copilot's wife. Told a newspaper that ""God landed that plane."" Yeah? Oh, God landed that plane? Well, I do believe God landed the plane. Same way I believe God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent. I'm fine with coffee, thank you. So, Len Caldwell really wanted to get here this morning. Len's the president of the pilots' union. He wanted to be here to meet with us and you, but they need him at the crash site. As you know, when a plane goes down, the NTSB sends a Go Team to the crash site immediately. They find the flight data recorder? They did. It's perfectly intact. Oh, great. Great, great, great. Then that solves everything. So why do we need a lawyer from Chicago? Well, Hugh specializes in criminal negligence. Criminal negligence? Death demands responsibility. Six dead on that plane, someone has to pay. Yeah, but that's a plane that fell apart at... Thank you. Fell apart at 30,000 feet. The airline will try to prove equipment failure, which is gonna make the manufacturer responsible. The manufacturer in turn is gonna try and prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline. Or pilot error. I flew the plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh. You get the picture? A hundred people, upside down, 500 feet off the ground. Do you have any idea what that's like? I do. I heard the black box recordings last night. Oh, you heard. Are you a pilot? No, I'm not. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, do you? Hugh's on our team, Whip. Is he? Yeah, he is. He doesn't act like he's on our team. Well, he is. Asking me questions about fucking pilot error. Listen, it's the NTSB's ball game. They run the investigation. And they will ultimately rule on the cause. And that's why we need him. Well, they interview the entire flight crew. They interview the passengers. They hold public hearings. All right, let's cut to the chase. Just tell me what it is I need to know, Charlie. The NTSB Go Team also collects blood, hair and skin samples from the entire flight crew for the purposes of a toxicology report. Okay. When do they want to do that? They've already done that. In the hospital. It's the first thing they do. You don't remember having your blood drawn the night of the crash? No. No. They get the results of this test? Yeah, they do.

That doesn't mean anything. I had a couple of beers the night before the flight. That made the tail of the plane explode? A couple of beers? Yeah, a couple of beers. You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie. Hugh is your lawyer. I need a bigger lawyer. I need a lawyer that understands that someone put me in a broken plane. Without me up there, there would have been 102 funerals, not six. We're not talking about funerals right now, Captain. Well, then what are we talking about? We're talking about prison time. What? Lawsuits. Somebody has to pay. What, write a check? It's not gonna be me, I promise you that. As long as they're writing checks, tell them to write one for me, too. Because someone put me in a broken plane. I'd love a check, Charlie. This toxicology report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine. Felonies punishable by up to 12 years in prison. And if it is proven that your intoxication was the cause of the death of the four passengers, now we're gonna look at four counts of manslaughter. That could be life in prison. Now can I please do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report? He's gonna get it done, Whip. He'll get it done. It's what his whole life's about. Trust me. Trust him. You don't have to worry, you'll walk away from this the hero. I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise you that I'm not worried. No one could have landed that plane like I did. No one. Thanks for coming. Yeah. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes. Yeah, let me have an orange juice. Large orange juice. Just orange juice? Yeah. No. Double Stoli. Neat. It paints a picture to me anyway of a real American hero. Is that your reading of it? Absolutely. However, remember, every situation is different. And the actions of the pilots on SouthJet 227 will be heavily scrutinized. Are you suggesting that there may be more to this than meets the eye? There always is. You don't have all the answers. You do have a lot of questions. We're gonna have to wait until some of those answers come in before we can say much more. Are you hinting here, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but are you hinting that this is suspicious?

Listen, I thought we'd take a ride. There's something I need to show you. Okay. There it is. You can see on initial impact, the left wing hit the ground. Think if it would have sheared off completely, everybody would have walked away from this plane. The wing snapped off and drove the engine cowling into the rear fuselage. Yeah. If you were sitting in the last six or seven rows, it was like being hit by a train. Who are they? The John the Baptist Pentecostal Mission. They helped pull survivors out of the wreckage. Now, they come out here every day. And that is Ellen Block. She's the head of the NTSB investigation. She's the one that's gonna be asking you the tough questions. I drank the night before the flight. I drank that morning, too. I used cocaine to help straighten myself out. I know. It's in the toxicology report. But that is not the reason why this happened. No, it's not. Listen. Clearly, there was a mechanical issue with the plane. Yeah, clearly. Yeah, but what you and I know, this was an act of God. And I'm going to fight to get the NTSB to add ""Act of God"" as one of the probable causes. Whose god would do this? Okay. So, here's the deal. Avington Carr, he's the owner of the airline, he's on our side. He's got big friends in Washington, too. He wants to have a sitdown with us tomorrow morning at 10:00. Good. Yeah. You can't drink, Captain. You're under the microscope right now. You can't be seen buying liquor. That means no bars, no drugs... I understand. I won't drink, I promise you. Look, we can get you help... I don't need help. I won't drink, I promise you. I can stop. On my own. Okay. Okay. Till 10:00. 10:00, I got it. Avington Carr. I never wanted that fucking airline. Neither did my brother. It was my father that wanted it. I like baseball. Oh, I like baseball. Everybody in Georgia likes baseball. The whole country likes baseball. Cut the crap. So, what's the deal, Lenny? Is your union going to survive this one? More importantly, how big a check you think I'm gonna have to write? You had six fatalities on board your aircraft. No, no, it's four, Lenny. The two crew members don't count. I don't mean they don't count. They don't get settlements like the passengers. Okay, that's a workman's comp claim, part of the union contract. They do a dangerous job. They know it. You the lawyer for the pilots' union?

But maybe I should bring him in... In a minute. All right, so let's get down to it, Lenny. What does the union plan to do about this blood test saying Whitaker was high on booze and coke? This guy's a real peach. I'm going to kill the toxicology report. The testing was done incompetently. The toxicology equipment they used was last calibrated in June of 2009. It's already 18 months past code. Their log, that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials, and when, is very incomplete. And they used a preservative in the blood that has been known to cause fermentation, and in some cases, register higher in an alcohol test. Now, I've done all this, I've only been here a few days, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. I can handle this. I like this guy, Lenny. Makes me want to go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet. Mr. Carr, we're going to fight to push all the fault onto the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield. And you think they're gonna just open their checkbook and buy us all lunch? Good fucking luck. What's my exposure, Jim? Well, the awards to the families could kill the airline. Fuck the airline. The insurance companies can have the goddamn airline. I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets. Speaking for the pilots' union, sir, we don't want to see your airline go away. We enjoy the contract you have with us. We're gonna protect Captain Whitaker, and in turn, we're gonna protect your airline. Does Whitaker know he's going to jail? My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr. He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail. The only question is, is he going to die in jail? You're wrong, Mr. Carr. Last time I checked, six counts of manslaughter is life in prison.

Well, my lack of sleep had nothing to do with that plane falling apart, Margaret. I'm just trying to get this thing straight. Now you think any other pilot could have landed that plane and saved more lives? I didn't say that, Whip. I can't imagine another... All right, then. Well, imagine your son, Trevor, in this church, looking at you in that box. Or my son visiting me in prison. And... Please, Whip, enough. Enough, Whip. And for the next 40 years... Don't you think we've all had enough? I need this, Margaret. What do you want me to say? I just... It was an ordinary day. The storm, after we took off, was very severe.

And they need someone to work the night shift and they asked me. It's time and a half, so... I got a vest. And a little name tag. Nice. I got you something. Yeah? Yeah. It's a P51 Mustang. I know it's a P51... Your daddy fly one of those? Yes, he did. It's cause for celebration. Oh, well, I promised Sheila that I'd go to this AA meeting now. She's my sponsor, the one that's been helping me. Can we celebrate tomorrow night? Yeah. Yeah, sure, come on. You know, you could come with me. To the meeting. It's an open meeting, meaning that anyone can come. Even you. So the cops got a flashlight on me behind the dumpster. I'm wearing nothing but my girlfriend's panties, I got vomit all down the front of my chest. And I say to them, ""I might have had two beers."" So that's how I got the nickname ""Two Beer Barry."" I'm getting the stink eye from Ed over here. Have I gone off format? My name is Barry and I am an alcoholic. Hi, Barry. Are there any other alcoholics present? I always love a meeting where we all have to identify at the top, because it forces me to be honest about who I really am. And I never told the truth out there, obviously. I lied about everything. I was taught in these rooms that I would never get sober if I kept lying, but that's what I was best at. If I knew anything in this world it was how to lie, especially about my drinking. But, whatever. I would lie about the name of my dog, I'd lie about the color of my own hair right to your face. And my whole life just became a series of lies strung together by me, one after the other. I'm going to go, okay? Sure. You got a ride home? Yeah. Sheila, she can give me a ride. This is Sheila. How you doing? I'm Sheila. That my lies would kill me. Left to their own devices, my lies would walk me out that door. Is it safe to say that Captain Whitaker remains a bit of a mystery? Those are your words, sir, not mine. I've been speaking to some people who are very close to the NTSB investigation. They are confident they will soon be able to determine exactly what brought this plane down. I'm sure they will, sir. Well, Ken and Vicky Evans, thank you both very much. Thank you, sir. And God bless you. How you feeling, Ken? Happy to be alive. Blessed to be alive. I'm Captain Whitaker. I was flying with... I know who you are. Excuse me. Could you give us some privacy, please? Thank you. So... How long have you been out of... Out of a coma? Yeah. Two days. Good. Well, look, I don't want to disrupt your whole day. And God knows you've been swamped by interviews and... You were brilliant on CNN, by the way. Both my legs are crushed. My pelvis is snapped. I'll probably never walk again, at least not without a walker or braces. I'll certainly never fly again. I'm very sorry, Ken. That plane was doomed the moment you sat in that cockpit. You reeked like gin or something. I called Vicky from the plane before we took off. That's when the rain kicked up. Well, I don't know how much you remember, but that plane, it started falling apart, Ken. I remember everything until we crashed. I know what went on. What are we trying to say, Ken? What are we talking about? I don't know, Captain Whitaker. What are we talking about? I'm just trying to get a sense from you about what you thought caused the crash. Was it the fact that you got on the plane still drunk from the night before? The NTSB is coming back tomorrow to finish taking a deposition from me. About the events on that flight. Do you think you'd be alive if I wasn't flying that plane? No. We'd all be dead. But are you going to argue with me that your physical state was tiptop? Wait. Sit. Please. I never shared my opinion about your physical state the morning of the flight. I never said a word. Okay. That crash was preordained. I prayed on it, Captain. Vicky and I both prayed on it. There is only one judge, sir. Praise Jesus. And he's got a higher plan for you. This event, although it's tragic in its loss of life, it's also a celebration of life. Nothing happens in the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake, sir. Praise Jesus. Captain. Will you pray with us? Jesus, our savior, we thank you for blessing Captain Whitaker. For guiding his hand on that fateful morning. Bye. Byebye. Thanks for the ride. Okay. Hi. Hey, hey. How you doing? Oh, hey. Look. Great, right? It's kind of beautiful. It is beautiful, isn't it?

I know how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, hearing officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning. Morning. What that video captures is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4,800 feet per minute in what is considered a ""full pitch nose down"" attitude. Then, at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created an animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. We're going to roll it. What do you mean ""Roll it""? We gotta do something to stop this dive. Margaret, what's your son's name? Trevor. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" What? Black box. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" I love you, Trevor. You be a good boy. Mommy loves you. Okay, here we go. I've got control. Oh, Lord Jesus! Flaps. Flaps! Speed brakes. Speed brakes! Margaret! Power! Gear up. Gear up! Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted! We're flying. We're level. We can maintain altitude like... Atlanta Center... SouthJet... 7. We are inverted. I... We are inverted. SouthJet 2... 7, did you say inverted? That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment on board flight 227, wherein you say, ""We're going to roll it."" ""Here we go. I've got control."" You made a very conscious decision to invert the aircraft, to roll the plane upside down, is that correct? I'm not sure if it was conscious. But... It was more like instinct. What led to that decision? I don't recall. Let me quote from an investigative summary. ""From 9:34 until 9:42, ""the events on the aircraft are,"" again I quote, ""bold and remarkable."" ""By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent"" ""and allowed the aircraft to level off,"" ""enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas"" ""and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field."" I heard a loud metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control. Yes. First Officer Evans' testimony confirms the same. I want to show you something. Nothing's happening. This remote isn't working. Apologies. I can do this manually. This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly that articulates the horizontal stabilizer, also known as the elevator. As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone. This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2011. It was never replaced. It had an additional 1,200 hours of flight on it. It finally failed. Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position, which forced the plane into a dive. The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, ""A catastrophic event from which recovery was improbable"" ""and stable flight impossible."" Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about the days leading and the hours leading up to the accident. But before I do, I want to remind you that you are under oath and that any testimony you give here today will be considered admissible in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings. Do you understand what that means? Captain Whitaker, for the record, I need you to verbalize your answer. I'm sorry. Yes, I understand. On the three days leading up to the accident, Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th, did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements? No, I did not. On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job? No, I did not. Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction? No. Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done.";0;9953;10896;0
5612;id_77;5;annotator_2;Easy Negative;[];[];174345;185953;tt1907668;Flight;23.976;"Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done. Due to the severe turbulence in the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane, is that correct? Yes, that's correct. I suspended the drink service on the plane. Are you aware that our investigators found two single service vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? Yes, I'm aware of that. There were five crew members on board that would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of these crew members, yourself, First Officer Evans, Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason, and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. Toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons, and one tested positive for alcohol. It registered a .17 blood alcohol level. Are you aware of that? Yeah, I'm aware of it now. Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work, is that correct? Outside of work? No, not really. Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem? No, I did not. Did you ever see her drink to excess? No, I did not. Were you aware that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines. No, I did not. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? Could you repeat the question? Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? I'm sorry, my what? Your opinion, Captain. Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissible in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those two bottles of vodka on the plane? God help me. I'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't hear you. What did you say? I said, ""God help me."" Yes, well, however, is it your opinion... It's my opinion. Trina did not drink that vodka. Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker? She saved the boy's life, that's... Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker? Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka because I drank the vodka. What the hell? Objection! Please be seated, sir. Sir. Captain Whitaker misspoke. I drank the vodka bottles. Didn't you hear me? I said I object! Please be seated, sir. This is not a courtroom. Well, I object anyway! I drank the vodka bottles on the plane. Captain Whitaker, on the three nights before the accident, October 11th... October 11th, October 12th, and 13th and 14th, I was intoxicated. I drank all of those days. I drank. In excess. On the morning of the accident... I was drunk. I'm drunk now. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block. Because I'm an alcoholic. That was it. I was finished. I was done. It was as if I had reached my lifelong limit of lies. I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker, 'cause if I had told just one more lie, I could have walked away from all that mess and kept my wings, kept my false sense of pride. And more importantly, I could have avoided being locked up in here with all you nice folks for the last 13 months. But I'm here. And I'll be here for at least the next four or five years. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's how the judge explained it to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA, they took away my pilot's license. And that's fair. My chances of ever flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. I've had a lot of time to think about it, all of it. I've been doing some writing. I wrote letters to each of the families that had lost loved ones. Some of them were able to hear my apology. Some of them never will. I also apologized to all the people that tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen. People like my wife, you know. My exwife and my son. And again, like I said, you know, some of them will never forgive me. Some of them will. But at least I'm sober. I thank God for that. I'm grateful for that.";0;10896;11622;0

And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all... Please come forward. Help us. So hot. He is so creepy. I wanna say something, because I think some of you might be wondering...

But please don't turn this investigation into a circus. Where's your wife, Nick? Let the police do their jobs. What did you do to your pregnant wife? Did you tell them that, Nick?

You scared me. Want a drink? Did you know she was pregnant? I told you, noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy. She doesn't even know Amy. They look like pretty good friends to me. Look, I don't know. But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant. We have her medical records coming. Good. So, let's talk while we wait. Let's start over here. The scene of the crime. You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions. Dozens and dozens. This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it. The whole thing looked staged. Watch this. And yet, they remained upright throughout this lifeanddeath struggle? I don't know. What do you want me to say? Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing? No. Because our guys did a luminol test. And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up. Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick. A lot. Oh, my God. Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up. Wait a second. Why would they mop up the blood... If they're trying to stage a crime scene? No blood and no body suggests kidnapping. It tells us, look at people outside the house. Like these homeless you keep mentioning. A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide. It tells us to look at people inside the house. Which is what we're doing here, Nick. I see. So, how was your marriage, Nick? Because right now, all we got is noelle. She says, ""not good."" Gil, what do you and your wife argue about? What pisses you off? Money, lack thereof. Me and my ex, it's the same. I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick. $117,000 in credit card debt. What? I pulled up some of the merchandise. There are these fun little splurges. I didn't buy any of this stuff. I don't even golf! I do! You bought great clubs. I like the robot dog. This is identity theft! This is a felony! We need to find out who did this! All right.

I don't want to talk to you again, ever... Without a lawyer. Margo! Hey. Just hold on a second. Let me finish. Nick? I hear you, I hear you. I was as surprised as... I know you're upset. I had no idea she was pregnant. Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't... you want to know the truth? The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

First thing you have to understand about Amy, she loves to teach lessons. Play God. Yeah, old testament God. Okay. Keep talking. She finds out I've been cheating on her with Andie... Decides to teach me a lesson. Fakes her own death, frames me for it. Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance. She does the treasure hunt. Now, the treasure hunt is critical. She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it. And she leaves clue number one for the police... Which will lead them back to my office... Which is a place where Andie and I would often... And she leaves a pair of red panties. Right. Racy, looks bad. Clue two. My father's house. Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations. Clue three? Woodshed. Also a location... Oh, my God. We had limited options. A hotel. Amy would have seen the credit card bill. Put it on Andie's credit card. Andie's statement went right to her parents. Nick, margo, can we head over to the little brown house? This leads us to what? My dad's house. Dad's house is blue. After the divorce, when dad wasn't coming around... I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. brown, who... For the sake of his children's safety, had to deny their existence. You never told me that. You told her that? We've got incriminating red panties in your office. We've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed. So, what in God's name is at your father's house, Nick? And be honest. I honestly have no idea. Whatever they found, I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad. We got a lot of uncontained issues here. Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is? We haven't communicated since the vigil. Okay. Amy's parents? No, it's... More pressure. We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment. No, Andie won't do that. She will. They always do. Don't take it personally. Amy's got us in an interesting bind. We need to tell the cops about Andie. Really? Right now, Andie just gives you another motive. We need to tell the cops about the woodshed. We need to be on the front end of that. But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen. They'll go after margo. They can't do that, can they? She's your accomplice. She helped you hide the evidence.

Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner... By a man with a history of mental problems? Please continue, Ms. dunne. Desi assaulted me that night. Every night. He tied me up like a dog.

It tells us to look at people inside the house. Which is what we're doing here, Nick. I see. So, how was your marriage, Nick? Because right now, all we got is noelle. She says, ""not good."" Gil, what do you and your wife argue about? What pisses you off? Money, lack thereof. Me and my ex, it's the same. I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick. $117,000 in credit card debt. What? I pulled up some of the merchandise. There are these fun little splurges. I didn't buy any of this stuff. I don't even golf! I do! You bought great clubs. I like the robot dog. This is identity theft! This is a felony! We need to find out who did this! All right. Let's talk about life insurance. Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance... To $1.2 million. Yes, I did. That was her idea. She wanted me to. You filed the paperwork.

Did you kill your wife, Nick? I did not kill my wife. I am not a murderer. But you were unfaithful. I was unfaithful. And I am deeply ashamed. And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents... Her friends, all the people in your hometown... Believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife. Well, I am desperate to find my missing wife. You say that, but I'm wondering how you expect us to believe you... Now that we know you're a liar. I didn't come forward with my affair... Because I knew it would make me look really, really bad. But I don't care about that anymore. I just want to find my wife. I'm just trying to get clear... let me be clear. Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy. I'm not a good guy. I was a bad husband to a great wife. I broke the vow that I made to her. Those are pretty words, Nick. But what does that really mean to you? It basically means that I was a con artist. I met Amy elliott seven years ago. I was completely transfixed. Amy can do that to you. I was this average guy from an average place... With mediocre aspirations. And I met a woman who dazzled me. And I wanted her to love me... So I pretended to be better than I was. When we got married, I promised to be that guy. That guy who works harder. That guy who, who lives and acts... And loves with as much passion as she does. But I failed her. Instead of doing what was right... I did what was easy. You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife.
