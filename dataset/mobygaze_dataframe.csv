What good is it? This grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. It's pretty vague. Where do you want to start looking? Maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. Let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr.Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact. I've heard this one, as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert 150 years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think. Not ""supposedly,"" Dr.Jones. This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story. It doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would. This tablet is one of those markers. It proves the knight's story is true. But as you pointed out, it's incomplete. Now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother.

What good is it? This grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. It's pretty vague. Where do you want to start looking? Maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing. Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway. Let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr.Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact. I've heard this one, as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert 150 years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think. Not ""supposedly,"" Dr.Jones. This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story. It doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would. This tablet is one of those markers. It proves the knight's story is true. But as you pointed out, it's incomplete. Now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy. As you can now see, Dr.Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost 2,000 years ago. We're only one step away. That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet. You could be more right than you know. Yes? We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished, along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Dr.Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man, and you will find the Grail. You've got the wrong Jones, Mr.Donovan. Why don't you try my father? We already have. Your father is the man who has disappeared. Your father and I have been friends since time began. I've watched you grow up, Indy. I've watched the two of you grow apart. I've never seen you this concerned about him before. Dad? He's an academic; a bookworm. He's not a field man. Dad? Dad? Dear God. What has the old fool got himself into now? I don't know, but whatever it is, he's in over his head. Dad? It's today's mail, and it's been opened. Mail. That's it, Marcus. Venice, Italy. What is it? It's Dad's Grail diary. Every clue he followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me? I don't know, but someone must want it pretty badly. Do you believe, Marcus? Do you believe the Grail actually exists? The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. But if you want facts, Indy, I've none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith. Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now. I'll tell him we'll take two. All right, tell me what's going to happen when we get to Venice. Don't worry, Dr.Schneider will be there to meet you. Uh, Schneider? I maintain an apartment in Venice.

I sure hope I don't let him down. I got to see a lot of the countryside. We would take these real long walks. And we were always looking for this guy named Charlie. Hold it up! Hold up, boys!

So, I started playing it all the time. I played PingPong even when I didn't have anyone to play PingPong with. The hospital's people said it made me look like a duck in water, whatever that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play. I played PingPong so much, I even played it in my sleep. Now, you listen to me. We all have a destiny. Nothing just happens, it's all part of a plan.

President Johnson awarded four Medals of Honor to men from each of the Armed Services. America owes you a debt of gratitude, son. I understand you were wounded. Where were you hit? In the buttocks, sir. That must be a sight. I'd kind of like to see that. God damn, son. After that, Mama went to the hotel to lay down, so I went out for a walk to see our nation's capital.

They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name, Forrest Gump. Mama said that the ""Forrest"" part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense. Okay... Get it, get it... Wait, is it this way? Hold on. All right...

If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs. Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about 1,000 years ago, something like that. Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms, Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that. That's how me and Mama got money. Mama was a real smart lady. Remember what I told you, Forrest. You're no different than anybody else is. Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You're the same as everybody else. You are no different. Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump. Now, his IQ is 75. Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock. She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School. I met the principal and all. I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump. Now, this is normal. Forrest is right here. The state requires a minimum IQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He's gonna have to go to a special school. Now, he'll be just fine. What does ""normal"" mean, anyway?

That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. I thought I was going back to Vietnam, but instead, they decided the best way for me to fight the Communists was to play PingPong. So, I was in the Special Services, traveling around the country cheering up all them wounded veterans and showing them how to play PingPong. I was so good that some years later the Army decided that I should be on the AllAmerican PingPong team. We were the first Americans to visit the land of China in like a million years, or something like that. Somebody said world peace was in our hands, but all I did was play PingPong. When I got home, I was a national celebrity. Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo. Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here. Mr. Gump, have a seat. Forrest Gump, John Lennon. Welcome home. You had quite a trip. Can you tell us, what was China like? In the land of China, people hardly got nothing at all. No possessions? And in China, they never go to church. No religion, too? Hard to imagine. Well, it's easy if you try, Dick. Some years later, that nice young man from England was on his way home to see his little boy and was signing some autographs, and for no particular reason at all, somebody shot him.

I can't believe it's really you. Now, for some reason, what I was doing seemed to make sense to people. I mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know? I said, ""Here's a guy that's got his act together. ""Here's somebody who's got it all figured out. ""Here's somebody who has the answer."" I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump. So, I got company. And after that, I got more company. And then, even more people joined in. Somebody later told me it gave people hope. Now... Now, I don't know anything about that, but some of those people asked me if I could help them out. Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering if you might help me, huh? Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business and I've been trying to think up a good slogan. And since you have been such a big inspiration to the people around here, I thought you might be able to help me jump into... Whoa, man! You just ran through a big pile of dog shit! It happens.

Another time, I was running along, somebody who had lost all his money in the Tshirt business, he wanted to put my face on a Tshirt, but he couldn't draw that well, and he didn't have a camera. Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway. Have a nice day. Well, some years later, I found out that that man did come up with an idea for a Tshirt. He made a lot of money off of it. Anyway, like I was saying, I had a lot of company. My mama always said, ""You got to put the past behind you before you can move on."" And I think that's what my running was all about. I had run for three years, two months, 14 days and 16 hours. Quiet. Quiet. He's going to say something. I'm pretty tired. Think I'll go home now. Now what are we supposed to do?

May I come in? Yeah, please do. You must be Jules... which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly... the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie? 100% Your wife Bonnie... comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., is that correct? Uhhuh. I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here... she wouldn't appreciate it none too much? She wouldn't at that. That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck out of Dodge... which, if you do what I say when I say it, should be plenty. Now, you got a corpse in a car... minus a head in a garage. Take me to it. Jimmie? Uhhuh. Do me a favor, will you? I thought I smelled some coffee back there. Would you make me a cup? Yeah, sure. Oh, how do you take it? Lots of cream, lots of sugar. About the car... is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, smoke, make a lot of noise? Is there gas in it? Anything? Aside from how it looks, the car is cool. Positive? Don't get me out there on the road... I find out the brake lights don't work. Man, far as I know, the motherfucker's tiptop. Good enough. Let's go back to the kitchen. Here you go, Mr. Wolf. Thank you, Jimmie. Mmm. OK, first thing... you two, take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now, Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the gar age... or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and shit? Yeah, Mr. Wolf. Under the sink. Good. What I need you two fellas to do... is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. I'm talking fast, fast, fast. Go in the back seat... scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery. Now, it don't need to be spickandspan. You don't need to eat off it. Just give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected... you got to soak that shit up. Now, Jimmie, we need to r aid your linen closet. I need blankets. I need comforters. I need quilts. I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're going to line the front seat and back seat... and the floorboards with quilts and blankets. So if a cop stops us and sticks his big snout in the car... the subterfuge won't last... but at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work. ""Please"" would be nice. Come again? I said a ""please"" would be nice. Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say ""please."" I'm here to tell you what to do. And if selfpreservation is an instinct you possess... you better fucking do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help is not appreciated, lots of luck, gentlemen. No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that. Your help is definitely appreciated. Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, OK? I respect you. I don't like people barking orders at me, that's all. If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast... and I need you guys to act fast if you want out of this... so pretty please with sugar on top... clean the fucking car. Don't be looking at me like that, all right? I can feel your look. It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. Green. Nothing except for the mess inside. Mmm, about twenty minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch. How we coming, Jimmie? Pretty good. I got it all here... but, uh... Mr. Wolf, you got to understand something. Winston, Jimmie, please. Winston. You got to understand something now, Winston. Uh, no, thank you. This is our best linen here... and it was a wedding present... from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny... and they're not with us anymore. I really want to help you guys out... Let me ask you a question, Jimmie... if you don't mind. No, please, go ahead. Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny... were they millionaires? No. Well, your Uncle Marsellus is... and I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt... Ginny. Ginny were here... they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set... which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do. I like oak myself. That's what I have in my bedroom. How about you, Jimmie?

That shit don't matter. You're judging this shit the wrong way. I mean, it could be God stopped the bullets... or he changed Coke to Pepsi, he found my fucking car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Now, whether or not what we experienced... was an ""According to Hoyle"" miracle... is insignificant... but what is significant is I felt the touch of God. God got involved. But why? Well, that's what's fucking with me. I don't know why, but I can't go back to sleep. You're serious? You're really thinking about quitting? The life? Yeah. Most definitely. Fuck. What you going to do, then? Well, that's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm going to deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm just going to walk the earth.

Let's go back to the kitchen. Here you go, Mr. Wolf. Thank you, Jimmie. Mmm. OK, first thing... you two, take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now, Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the gar age... or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and shit? Yeah, Mr. Wolf. Under the sink. Good. What I need you two fellas to do... is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. I'm talking fast, fast, fast. Go in the back seat... scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery. Now, it don't need to be spickandspan. You don't need to eat off it. Just give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected... you got to soak that shit up. Now, Jimmie, we need to r aid your linen closet. I need blankets. I need comforters. I need quilts. I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're going to line the front seat and back seat... and the floorboards with quilts and blankets. So if a cop stops us and sticks his big snout in the car... the subterfuge won't last... but at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.

No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that. Your help is definitely appreciated. Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, OK? I respect you. I don't like people barking orders at me, that's all. If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor.

So, you said he came in your room, and he was yelling? Huh. Please, come on. He was... Come on. Yeah, I know... He was... I was... I remember I was defending my mother, and I was trying to, you know, make peace in the lamest way. I said... I said, ""She's not naked. It's art."" And he started hitting me, and he... beat me unconscious. And he talked to me less and less after that. I mean, he knew what I was before I did. And the morning that I left for college, he walked into my room. And he held out his hand. And it was filled with money. A big... sweaty wad of money. And he said, ""I don't want you to ever come back."" And I just grabbed him, and I hugged him, and he turned and walked out. Hey, we all have these terrible stories to get over, and you... That's not true. Some of us have great stories, pretty stories, that take place at lakes with boats... and friends and noodle salad. Just no one in this car. But a lot of people... that's their story. Good times. Noodle salad. What makes it so hard is not that you had it bad, but that you're that pissed... that so many others had it good. No, I don't think so. Not it at all, really. Not it at all, huh? Okay. Let's, go to the hotel, and, tomorrow you'll see if you can get another big wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal with that pressure. So, what happens? She splits, right down to the keel. And the stern... ...falls back level.

You can do this dance if you want to, but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report comes back tomorrow it's going to say that Detective Lewis was coked out of his head. Fucking black people, huh?

Bias in the judicial system. All that stuff. All that stuff! But still, it's gotta get to you, on a gut level as a black man. They just can't keep their hands out of the cookie jar. Of course, you and I know that's not the truth. But that's the way it always plays, doesn't it? And assholes like Lewis keep feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you. What did you say you did for the D.A. Again? You coach ball down in Compton. Am I right? Oh, please, don't do that. Don't act like you know something about me, okay? What do you think those kids need... to make them believe, to give them hope? You think they need another drugdealing cop or do you think they need a fallen black hero? Why don't you cut through the bullshit and just tell me what it is you want. The D.A.'s squad loses its lead investigator next month. Rick is quite adamant that his replacement be a person of color. It's a highprofile position, and he wants to send the right message to the community. And the right message is, ""Look at this black boy I just bought?"" Well, fuck you very much. But thanks for thinking of me. Actually we were thinking of you. Until we saw that. It's your brother's file. Twentysomething years old and already three felonies. Three strikes law. Kid's going away for life for stealing a car. Christ, that's a shitty law. There's a warrant in there. But still, hey, he had every opportunity you had. Fucking black people, huh? So all, uh... all I need to do to make this disappear is to frame a potentially innocent man? What are you? The fucking defender of all things white? We're talking about a white man who shot three black men. And you're arguing with me that maybe we're not being fair to him? You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe Lewis did provoke this. And maybe he got exactly what was coming to him. Or maybe stoned or not, just being a black man in the Valley was enough to get him killed. There was no one there to see who shot first, so there is no way to know. Which means we could get this wrong. Maybe that's what happened with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong. Maybe Lewis isn't the only one who deserves the benefit of the doubt. You're the one closest to all this. You need to tell us. What does your gut tell you?";6175;6521

Are you having boy trouble 'cause I gotta be honest; I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition, That's kind of messed up. No, dad! I mean, that's pretty skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy? Please stop. Tore up from the floor up? That's not what it's about. I just need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever. It's not easy, that's for sure. I don't have the best track record in the world, I know, but, I've been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy. Look... ...In my opinion... The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, Handsome, what have you, the right person is still gonna think the sun shines out of your ass. That's the kind of person that's worth sticking with. Yeah. I think I've found that person. Yeah, sure you have. Your old DAD! You know I'll always be there to love you, support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in. Obviously.

They've been trying to have a kid for five years. We found them in the Penny Saver next to the exotic birds. They have a legitimate lawyer and I was going to go meet with them next weekend. Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now. I know... ...It's just that I'm not ready to be a mom. Damn Skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds. That was once! And she did not die, if you recall! Honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative? No. Well, you're a little Viking! First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins, Incidentally, they do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus.

Not like those people with fake woods in the background, Honestly, who do they think they're fooling? You found us in the Penny Saver? Hi. Mark Loring. I'm the husband. How you doing? Mac McGuff. Nice to meet you. Hi. This is Gerta Rauss, our attorney. Gerta Rauss. Hi, pleased to meet you. And this, of course, is Juno. Like the city in Alaska. No. No? Hon? Shall we sit down and get to know one another? I thought I'd get some drinks. What would anyone like? I have Pellegrino or Vitamin Water or orange juice. A Maker's Mark, please. Up. She's kidding. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, just one of her many genetic gifts. I see. So, Juno. First off, how far along are you? I'm a junior. No, I mean in your pregnancy. Oh. Uh, actually my stepmom took me yesterday to the doctor and they said I was twelve weeks. Oh, that's marvelous. So you're into your second trimester? Yeah, apparently. I'm due on May 4. Great. My girlfriends tell me the first couple months are the hardest. I didn't notice it at all. I'm more concerned about when they have to put that elastic band in the front of my jeans. I think pregnancy is beautiful. Well, you're lucky it's not you. So, let's talk how we're gonna do this... thing. Well, don't I just have the thing? Squeeze it on out and hand it over? Mark and Vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption. What does that mean? It means they'd send annual updates, photos, let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up. Whoah. I don't want photos or any kind of notification. Can't we just kick this old school? I stick the baby in a basket and send it your way. Like Moses in the reeds. Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament. Exactly! Right? Do you know what I mean? Like in the good old days. When it was quick and dirty. Well, then we all agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved? Shit, yes, just close her on up. Obviously, we would compensate you for all your medical expenses. Are you looking for any other type of compensation? Excuse me? No. No, I don't want to sell the thing, I just... ...I want... ...I just want the baby to be with people who are gonna love it, And be good parents, you know? I'm in high school. I'm illequipped. You're doing a beautiful and a selfless thing for us. Vanessa has wanted a baby ever since we got married. I want to be a mommy so badly! You don't say. Have you ever felt like you were just born to do something? Yes. Heating and air conditioning. There you go. I was born to be a mother. Some of us are. How about you, Mark, are you looking forward to being a dad? Betcha, yeah. Every guy wants to be a father. Wants to coach the soccer team and help out with the science fair and the volcano goes off. Yeah, all that. Maybe Gerta could take us through the preliminary documents that you have drawn up. Could I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes me pee like Seabiscuit. The downstairs bathroom is being retiled, but if you go upstairs, then to the right... Oh yeah! Room with the toilet. Is she alright? Sorry. Sorry, I didn't expect to see you up here. I just came up to get something. Did your wife send you up here to spy on me? No. Do we come off as paranoid yuppies or something? I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume. Really? It's Clinique Happy. Get a whiff of those sparkling topnotes! Is that supposed to make me feel happy? You should feel happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when it comes out all covered in... Viscera? Blood and guts. Is that a Les Paul? Yes, it is. Vanessa gave me my own room for all my stuff. She gave you your own room in your whole house for your stuff? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark. Oh, it's beautiful. You know? I always loved Gibson way more than Fender. What do you play? I rock a Harmony. So is it mahagony? What happens if you crack the neck? Tell me about it. I used to play in this really tight band when I lived in Chicago and one night we opened up for the Melvins and I busted that thing right on stage and it cost me $800 just to get it fixed. When was that? Â93. Best time for rock and roll. Nuhuh, '77! Punk Volume #1. You're crazy. You weren't there, You couldn't understand the magic. You weren't even alive! What's that? It's a Pilates machine. What do you make with it? You don't make anything. It's for exercising. My wife ordered one of those Tony Little Gazelles off the TV. You know, from the guy with the ponytail? That guy just doesn't look right to me. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. You're playing music? Juno wanted a little closer look at Kimber. Your guitar is named Kimber? Yeah. That's cool. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. He was the hot one with polio. Gerta is downstairs, we still have a lot of stuff to go over. I got it. Not to interrupt the jam session. So, just look these over and if you have any questions, call me at my office. We would really appreciate it if you would just keep us updated on any doctor's appointments, Ultrasounds, anything of that nature. For sure. You want to know how your kid is cooking, I get it. You think you're really going to do this, then? Yeah. I like you guys. How sure would you say you are? Would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure? I'm going to say I'm about 104% sure. Really? Seriously, if I could just have the thing and give it to you now, I totally would, But I'm guessing it looks probably like a Sea Monkey right now, And we should let it get a little cuter, right? Yeah. Great. Keep it in the oven. I think that's a great idea. Nice to meet you both. Please, drive carefully. Hopefully we'll hear from you soon. Take care. Buh bye. Hey, man. Hey, Vijay. Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant? Yeah. Like our moms and teachers! Yeah. Did you hear it's yours? Yup. What a trip, man. I don't really know too much about it. You should grow a moustache. I can't. Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants. Raise my sperm count. Juno, hey. Hey, Bleek. Me and some guys are gonna go to the movies after school and we're gonna donut that flick with the guy who has eighteen kids. Do you want to come? Sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound. Oh, really? Can I... ...Should I come? Oh, you can't waste those donut balls, But maybe I could drop by later. Okay, cool. Later, Bleek. See ya. I'll save you a seat. There's your baby. Oh, my God. There's a hand. And an arm. And there's the feet. Would you look at that? Check out Baby BigHead. Dude, that thing is freaky looking! Excuse me, I am a sacred vessel. All you've got in your stomach is Taco Bell! It's amazing that there's actually saps that cry at this. What? I'm not made of stone. Well, there you have it. Would you like to know the sex? Yes. No. Please, Junebug? No sex. Planning to be surprised when you deliver? I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if you told me, I'll just ruin everything. Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school? No, they're the adoptive parents. Oh. Well, thank goodness for that. What's that supposed to mean? I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment to raise a baby in. How do you know that I'm so poisonous? What if these adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters? Or like stage parents. They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that? No, I guess not. What is your job title, exactly? I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am. Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know. Excuse me? You think you're so special because you get to play Picture Pages up there? My five yearold daughter could do that, and let me tell you... ...she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade! Bren, you's a dick! I love it. Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. I have something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here? No, actually she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue as much time off as she can before... Oh right. I hear these are quite the timesuck. Wanna come in? I was just having a Ginseng Cooler. Would you like one? What is it with you rich people and your herbinfused juices? It's probably got something to do with those forty fourpacks they come in. They're not bad, though. Why aren't you at work? I work mostly from home. I'm a composer. No shit. Like Johannes Brahms? No, more commercial stuff. Like what? Commercials. Have you seen the ads for the Titanium Power men's deodorant? Paid for this kitchen. You're quite the sellout, Mark. What would the Melvins say? Did you say you had something to show me. Behold, good sir! Your future child. Hey, look at that. I think it looks like my friend Paulie. Is he also bald and amorphous? No, he's the dad. Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl? I can't, the doctor can. But I kind of want it to be a surprise. Well, it can only go one of two ways. That's what you think. I drink tons of booze... ...so you might end up with one of those scary neuterbabies that's born without junk. Junk, huh? You know, it's parts. I know what junk is. Yeah, right. We definitely want it to have some junk, please. Well, you don't need to worry about a thing. My stepmom, Bren, makes me eat super healthy. I can't stand in front of the microwave and no red M I hope you're ready. Ooh... do you hear that? What? This is my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing ""Superstar"" by the Carpenters. Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Carpenters. Chick drummer, freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes. You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Just listen. Yeah, I like this. What did you say your favorite band was? Didn't. It's a threeway tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways. I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid's in there. The Wizard of Gore? That is Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror. Please. Dario Argento is so the ultimate master of horror. Argento? He's alright, but Lewis is completely dimented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup all over the place. Fake brains coming out the yinyang. Quite frankly, this looks a little stupid. Give me the tape. This is even better than Suspiria. What'd I tell ya? You have decent taste in slasher movies. Here's to dovetailing interests. Have you guys thought of any names for the baby yet? Sort of, yes. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl. Madison? Isn't that a little, gay? Well, pretentious much? Should everyone just have a mysterious name like Juno? My dad went through this huge obsession with Roman and Greek mythology. He decided to name me after Zeus's wife, Zeus had tons of lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross. That suits you. Thanks? You're something else. Vanessa. You'd better go. She hates when I sit around watching movies and I don't contribute. I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing momtype rage. No, Juno, no. Juno, what's going on? Nothing. What are you doing here? What's wrong? Nothing, I went to the doctor today. Is there something wrong with the baby? The baby is great. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Here. It's the baby. It's your baby. It kinda looks like it's waving. Like it's saying ""Hey, Vanessa. Will you be my mom?"" Yeah, it kind of does. Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today. I came as soon as I got that ultrasound goo off my pelvis. It was crazy actually, My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we got escorted off the premises. Wow, what kind of swag did you score? Mall madness, huh? It's just some stuff I picked up for the baby. Don't you usually get all that stuff at a baby shower? When my stepmom was pregnant with my little sister she got a million gifts. But I wasn't jealous 'cause they all were super lame. I doubt anyone's gonna throw us a shower. Why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower? I don't think people know how to feel about this situation because it's not set in stone. What isn't set... You don't think I'm going to flake out on you? No, I don't, Juno. We went through a situation before where it didn't work out. Cold feet. You should have gone to China. I hear they give away babies like free iPods. They put them in those Tshirt guns and shoot them out at sporting events. Your parents are probably wondering where you are. Naah. I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into? I should probably bounce. Hey, don't forget your bag. Ah, bag! Okay, take care. Where the hell have you been, Junebug? I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. I ended up staying for a couple of hours. A couple of hours? Why are you going over there in the first place? They wanted to know about this stuff. I said I'd keep them updated, so I did! You could have mailed it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere? I don't know, I just did. And while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa, we watched The Wizard of Gore, And he burned me a couple of CDs of this weird music. He's kind of cool. Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that. No, it was not a big deal. He was totally cool with it. You don't understand. Mark is a married man, there are boundaries. Oh, come on. Listen, Brenduhhh. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else. What does it even matter if he's married? I can have friends that are married. It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage. You don't know anything about me! I know enough. We don't even have a dog! Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno. But in a couple years when you move out I'm going to get Weimaraners. Wow, dream big! Oh, go fly a kite. Hi, Juno. What can I do for you? Bleeker home? Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once. But now she looks a hobbit. You know, the fat one that was in The Goonies. Hey, man, Don't concentrate so hard. I think I can smell your hair all burning. Hey, what's up? Not much, I just wanted to come say hey. I miss hanging out with you on school nights. Orange TicTacs are Bleeker's one and only vice. The day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious. You seem to be getting... ...pregnanter these days. Ya know, I set up this whole private adoption... ...and this married couple in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents. Really? What are they like? The guy, he's awesome. His name is Mark and he likes old horror movies and he plays the guitar. We actually hung out this afternoon. Is that normal? Probably not, but... I talked to dad and Bren and they said they wouldn't narc you out to your folks, So, I think we should be cool. That's a relief. I'm gonna start looking like a pretty big dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute when I'm huge? I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful. Jeez, Bleek. I do. Hey Junebug, when this is all over we should get the band back together. Yeah. That would be awesome. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we're just, like, ready to rock. We could always get back together too. That's an option. Were we together? Yeah, we were once. That time. What about Katrina De Voort? You could totally go out with Katrina De Voort. I don't like Katrina. She smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup. Okay. So we have Custard, Cheesecake. They're yellow. I wanted to pick something that was genderneutral until we get the baby and then we can add a more decisive palette. Why does everyone think yellow is genderneutral? I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom. I'm thinking more Custard with this light. I don't know. Maybe I should paint a larger swatch... Or you could wait a few more months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here demanding dessertcolored walls. ""What to Expect"" says that readying the baby's room is an important process for the woman. Especially if you're adopting. It's called ""nesting."" Nesting? Are you going to build the crib out of sticks and spit? You should read the book. I flagged the ""daddy chapters"" for you. I think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion. I disagree. This wall is going to need something. Our first family photo right in the middle. Right up there. Can you see it? Yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut! Share the love, sweetness! You can't have any. She's assaulting me! She's denying me freshbaked goodness! Oh, my God. That's her. That's Vanessa Loring. Of the Penny Saver Lorings? Dude, she's, like, really pretty. You sound totally shocked or something. She's totally gonna steal that kid for her collection. Right, seriously. Boring! I could so go for a huge cookie right now with like, a lamb kebab, simultaneously. God, Spermy. Must you always feed? It's like, neverending for you. Juno! Hi, Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? I was just shopping with my girlfriends. You're gay? No. Just ignore her. Well, how are you feeling? Great! Everything's stupendous. Oh, coming in on that snooze button. That's incredible. Oh, God. What? Kicking away. Could I feel it? Are you kidding? At school everyone's just grabbing my belly all the time. I'm a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale. I can't feel anything. It's not moving for me. You should try talking to it. They can hear you, even though it's all ten thousand leagues under the sea. Hi, baby. It's me. It's Vanessa. I can't wait to meet you. Can you hear me, baby? Sweet angel? I felt it! That was magical. Thank you. Thank you. Hello? Hey! So, I've been listening to that really weird CD that you made me. Yeah? What's the verdict? Well, it's cute. It's cute? When you're used to listening to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else just sounds kind of precious in comparison. I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point. Well... ...consider it your musical education. I can't wait to see what you've got to teach me. Stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to call and say hi. Go learn something. Oh, a little trip down Mexico way. And Greece and China apparently. How many months has it been now? You're getting huge. It's homing in on the eight. You should see how weird I look naked. I wish my funbags would get bigger. Trust me, you don't. I have to actually wear a friggin' bra now and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff on myself so my skin won't explode. Hot! Why is everyone always staring at me? Well, you are kind of convex, you know? Whoah! Who's been doing their geometry homework for once! I have no choice. Keith has been grading me so hard lately. Do not call Mr. Conyers ""Keith"". 'Cause my barf reflex is really enheightened these days. But Keith's hot. Eww, he's all beardy! Did you hear that Bleek is going to the prom with Katrina De Voort? Katrina? No way, he doesn't like Katrina. Must be like a pity date or something. I heard he asked her and that they're going to Benihana, and then prom, and then Vijay's parents' cabin. He told me that Katrina's house smells like soup! Oh my God, it totally does. I was there four years ago for her birthday party and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured way worse things for nookie. Oh, please. There is no way that they're having sex, They wouldn't even be holding hands. I wouldn't be so sure, he did it with you. Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me. We're best friends. Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did. Not jealous, don't care. I know Bleek doesn't like Katrina and he shouldn't toy with her emotions like that. She seems pretty nice. Uhhuh, I'm really convinced.";1376;5664

Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then go the prom, then go to Vijay's parents' cabin. We're getting a stretch limo. Your mom must be pretty stoked that you're not taking me. You're mad. Why are you mad? I'm not mad. I'm in a great mood. Despite the fact that I'm in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that pretty much everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday.

I might pumice my feet or go to Bren's Unitarian church, maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice. All those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you. You're being really immature. You have no reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked off at you. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore. Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you, and then I didn't wanna, like, marry you? Like I'd marry you! You'd be the meanest wife ever.

You're just not trying hard enough. I'm such an idiot. I can't believe what an idiot I am. No, you know what, Mark. Do not divorce your wife! Will you please just do me a solid and stay with Vanessa? You're so young. I'm not that young. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to know when someone's acting like a total ahole! Oh, and you know what, I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks! It's just noise! Juno? What's going on? Nothing. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. I'm just allergic to fine home furnishings. What's the matter? What's the matter? She's just a little hormonal.

Vanessa, I know we're prepared. I'm just wondering if... I'm ready. Wait a minute. Juno, don't listen to him. He's just got cold feet. He's just being a guy. The books all say the same thing. A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant. A man becomes a father when he sees his baby. He's going to get there. It just happened so fast. We put the ad in the paper and I thought it was gonna take months if at all and then, Two weeks later, she's on that couch. She answered our prayers. Ever since then it's been like a ticking clock. What are you saying? That it feels a little like bad timing. What would be a good time for you, Mark? There's just some things that I still want to do. Like what? Be a rock star? Don't mock me. I'm just saying that this is, This is something that's never going to happen. Your shirt is stupid. Grow up. If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a mother. I never said I'd be a good father. I called Gerta Rauss and she said that she can represent both of us. It's called a ""collaborative divorce."" It's all the rage right now, supposedly. And it would be pretty easy because we don't have any children. Thanks for making the call, I guess. Have you found a place to stay yet? Yeah, downtown. A hotel? No, it's not a hotel. It's a loft. Aren't you the cool guy? I wanted a baby so bad. I know. It looks like a bill from JiffyLube. It's for me.

Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy? Please stop. Tore up from the floor up? That's not what it's about.

There are just a few things about Marley you're gonna need to know. He eats three times a day. If he looks starved, feed him again. Now, of course, all of this food is gonna have to go somewhere... so use the blue pooper scooper, and watch your step. Don't worry about the color. He likes mangoes. Marley is not allowed to drink out of the toilet... so be sure to keep the lid closed... and the brick on the lid. You know, actually, you might want... to just keep the bathroom door shut in general. Like most dogs, Marley needs a lot of exercise... so try to take him for a walk or a run every morning and every evening. Marley, let go! Let go. Let go. Let go. Aaah! Marley, no!

We don't exactly know why this happens. Most likely he ate or drank something quickly and his stomach just flipped. I did manage to get a tube down there to relieve some of the gas. I think I untwisted it. He seems okay. For now, he's good. The problem is that once this happens, it almost always happens again. And if it does, I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do for him. He's an older dog. I honestly don't think he would survive the surgery. Well, we have to make sure that doesn't happen again. Well, most likely, it is gonna happen again. Well, we also talked about that maybe he ate too fast or drank too quickly. Right. So maybe it doesn't have to happen again. We'll monitor that. I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself that he may not make it through the night. Maybe 10%% of dogs survive this kind of a thing. WhatWhat is that number based on? What is it based on? Yeah, the reason why I ask... is I bet that number's based on regular dogs. Regular dogs? Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs. I know people probably say that all the time, but to be honest... I'm not sure he really is a dog. He once ate an answering machine. Just polished it off. He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested it. Then went and had the phone for dessert. Another time, my son had colic and this guy sat up all night, didn't move... just stayed right there for nine hours just keeping an eye on Conor.

You okay? Stay there. Why did his stomach twist? We don't exactly know why this happens. Most likely he ate or drank something quickly and his stomach just flipped. I did manage to get a tube down there to relieve some of the gas. I think I untwisted it. He seems okay. For now, he's good. The problem is that once this happens, it almost always happens again. And if it does, I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do for him. He's an older dog. I honestly don't think he would survive the surgery. Well, we have to make sure that doesn't happen again. Well, most likely, it is gonna happen again. Well, we also talked about that maybe he ate too fast or drank too quickly. Right. So maybe it doesn't have to happen again. We'll monitor that. I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself that he may not make it through the night. Maybe 10%% of dogs survive this kind of a thing. WhatWhat is that number based on? What is it based on? Yeah, the reason why I ask... is I bet that number's based on regular dogs. Regular dogs? Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs. I know people probably say that all the time, but to be honest... I'm not sure he really is a dog. He once ate an answering machine. Just polished it off. He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested it. Then went and had the phone for dessert. Another time, my son had colic and this guy sat up all night, didn't move... just stayed right there for nine hours just keeping an eye on Conor.

I think we're asking the wrong questions. What questions should we be asking? Well, let's start with this. Where is our satellite? We lost contact with it. In the scheme ofthings, the loss of one satellite isn't necessarily our concern. D.S.C.S.3 stands for Defense Systems Communications Satellite. Remember what it communicates with? They were able to access our defense mainframe via that satellite. That's how they temporarily shut down our missile defenses and entered our airspace. [ General ] We have changed all the codes. And on top of that, there is a vast amount ofvital intelligence on that mainframe. They know everything about us now. And we know nothing about them. Almost nothing.

The D.N.A. samples we've taken seem to represent three distinct life forms. Three different D.N.A. types? Yes, including the being's brain. The body tissue is human, as far as we can tell. The gray flesh encasing it is organic material. Some kind of bioengineered space suit. What it resembles, oddly enough, is placental tissue. Which makes sense, given that placenta's a lifesupport system. And that basically, in order to survive in our environment, the being had to be born here... in its human form. They must've come here in the past and obtained a D.N.A. sample from a human subject. Now, since that birth, the being has grown exponentially. This is one hour after surgery. Three hours. Six hours.

Until this situation has some kind of resolve, I am the eyes and the ears ofthe presidency. So, what do we know? Madam Secretary, we lost contact with one of our D.S.C.S.3 listening satellites... orbiting Earth. What is that image? Are you saying the sphere in Central Park isn't the only one? In fact, we have intelligence... that smaller spheres have landed at other locations around the world. Do we have briefings on that? And where are these spheres right now? How is that even possible? I think we're asking the wrong questions. What questions should we be asking? Well, let's start with this. Where is our satellite? We lost contact with it. In the scheme ofthings, the loss of one satellite isn't necessarily our concern. D.S.C.S.3 stands for Defense Systems Communications Satellite. Remember what it communicates with? They were able to access our defense mainframe via that satellite. That's how they temporarily shut down our missile defenses and entered our airspace. [ General ] We have changed all the codes. And on top of that, there is a vast amount ofvital intelligence on that mainframe. They know everything about us now. And we know nothing about them. Almost nothing. The fact that they chose to disable our defenses tells us... something about their intentions.;2615;2714

Madam Secretary, we brought in several specialists... to analyze the tissue samples we harvested from the being. This is our chief geneticist, Dr. Hideo Ikegawa. This is our chief astrobiologist, Dr. Helen Benson. Hello. Doctor? The being is in a nascent state. The D.N.A. samples we've taken seem to represent three distinct life forms. Three different D.N.A. types? Yes, including the being's brain. The body tissue is human, as far as we can tell. The gray flesh encasing it is organic material. Some kind of bioengineered space suit. What it resembles, oddly enough, is placental tissue. Which makes sense, given that placenta's a lifesupport system. And that basically, in order to survive in our environment, the being had to be born here... in its human form. They must've come here in the past and obtained a D.N.A. sample from a human subject. Now, since that birth, the being has grown exponentially. This is one hour after surgery. Three hours. Six hours. How much can you tell us about it... by decoding its D.N.A.? [ Dr. Ikegawa ] Um, you don't understand. These are the Dead Sea Scrolls. Geneticists... are gonna be studying this code for generations. No, they aren't. This code is the property ofthe U.S. government. Its very existence is classified. I wanna see it. [ Controlled Breathing ];2714;2850

It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear. Listen, I need to ask you something. Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game? I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that. Why? These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet. I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay?

No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games. Guess what? What? Nikki replied to your letter.

Okay. Sorry. ""Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about 'Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki. "" I think I'm done for today, okay? She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be.

I'm the reason why today happened? I think so. Let's talk about that. Be my guest. The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twentysix. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS. She's right, Dad. The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty seven to fourteen. Wow. The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two. Oh, wow. Let me think about that. Wait a minute. Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven. He was with you? He was with me. We went for a run. Really? That's crazy. There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants. She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts. Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know? ""Excelsior. "" Look it up. Yeah, ""Excelsior. "" Oh Pat. Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is ""Excelsior, "" to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation. Unbelievable. Wow. How did you know all that stuff? I did my research. Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed. Thank you. I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do. Oh, now you like her, Dad? I have to say I do. Yup. Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?

How do you want me to prove it? How's he gonna prove it? By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying? Against the Cowboys. That's your team isn't it, Randy? That's his team! I know who his team is. When is the game? December twentyeight, last game of the season. Oh, my God. Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition. Oh God. Randy, I thought they were America's Team. Don't you believe in America's Team?

No. No, Patrizio I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I'll take the action. I'll take it. Dad! Patrizio, don't! It's toxic! I have faith, I have faith. Excelsior belongs in this house Dad ... not in the State of New York. In this house. Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that ""Excelsior"" was the state motto of New York, okay?

Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough. Randy, what do you say? My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points. I'll give you three more. Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet! In fact, I'll give you ten points. No, Dad! Dad! Dad! You have to take that bet on the Cowboys. Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus! How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. What's that? Tiffany, what's that? What? No, no, no, no. You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay. What? No parlay! No! No, don't do it. Don't do it. Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything? I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores. Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good? We suck. We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there. And how are the people you're competing against? They're good. Some of them are professionals. They're good? Better than you? A lot better. A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right? No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break! We can't get five! Give 'em a five. Give 'em a five. We can do a five. What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance! That's the parlay. Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please? You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance. That's very, very manic indeed. That's the parlay. Shake on it. You know what?

Can't somebody say, ""Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?"" Pat, you owe us an apology. Mom, for what, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here. Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too. Why didn't you run with me? Huh! I was reading. Please. Do us a favor, don't read for a while. What are you wearing a garbage bag for? I'm gonna go run now. Wait, wait, wait. You have to fix this window. I'll fix it when I get back. Fix it now. Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy. I don't wanna go to therapy. You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go.

With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been whiteknuckling it this whole time. That had to be hard. Yeah.

Youhave a restraining order. Yeah, Dad, I know. Thank you, Officer. If you need anything... my card. Thank you. Sorry. We understand. Since when do cops have cards? Tell me one thing. Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your medication and if you do fine, we'll reduce them. Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication. Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one. Let me say something, I gotta say something. Okay. This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining. Work on a strategy, okay?

I wish I was wearing that jersey. I feel like an idiot. Are you comfortable? Veronica's not gonna like it. Get over here. Plus you got a tie on. Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come. Really? Get over here. DeSean Jackson's in the house! You mean rookie of the year? Yeah. DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson? Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.

The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twentysix. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS. She's right, Dad. The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty seven to fourteen. Wow. The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two. Oh, wow. Let me think about that. Wait a minute. Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven. He was with you? He was with me. We went for a run. Really? That's crazy. There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants. She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts. Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know? ""Excelsior. "" Look it up. Yeah, ""Excelsior. "" Oh Pat. Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is ""Excelsior, "" to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation. Unbelievable. Wow. How did you know all that stuff? I did my research. Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed. Thank you. I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do. Oh, now you like her, Dad? I have to say I do. Yup. Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil. Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years. Is that right? You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it! That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that! You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it. Yeah, prove it, prove it! How do you want me to prove it? How's he gonna prove it? By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying? Against the Cowboys. That's your team isn't it, Randy? That's his team! I know who his team is. When is the game? December twentyeight, last game of the season. Oh, my God. Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition. Oh God. Randy, I thought they were America's Team. Don't you believe in America's Team? Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team? Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing. I like it. No. No, Patrizio I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I'll take the action. I'll take it. Dad! Patrizio, don't! It's toxic! I have faith, I have faith.

My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points. I'll give you three more. Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet! In fact, I'll give you ten points. No, Dad! Dad! Dad! You have to take that bet on the Cowboys. Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus! How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. What's that? Tiffany, what's that? What? No, no, no, no. You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay. What? No parlay! No! No, don't do it. Don't do it. Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything? I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores. Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good? We suck. We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there. And how are the people you're competing against? They're good. Some of them are professionals. They're good? Better than you? A lot better. A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right? No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break! We can't get five! Give 'em a five. Give 'em a five. We can do a five. What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance! That's the parlay. Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please? You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance. That's very, very manic indeed. That's the parlay. Shake on it. You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. Randy, Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out. Pat, you can't quit. I'm not doing the dance. I'm out. Pat, calm down. Thank about it. See you later. Pat, no. What are you doing? Pat. I'm out. Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go. What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on... I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

Pat! I told you not to push it. Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing. He can't be a quitter. He cannot be a quitter. You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it. There's only one way to get him to show. What's that? Oh, what's that?

And she had some pretty big ideas that she challenged me with. And my first reaction was, ""Who does this kid think that she is?"" But after I gave it a listen, she really knocked me out. So... With a peek into our future, Natalie Keener. If there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this. Glocal? Glocal. Our global must become local. This company keeps 23 people on the road at least 250 days a year. It's expensive and it's inefficient When I came to Craig three months ago with this, he told me, and quite astutely, it's only a problem if you have a solution. Well, today I stand before you with just that. You all know Ned in reception. Today I'm gonna fire Ned. Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR will hire you back this afternoon. We'll see about that. Now Ned could be any employee in any one of our clients' locations worldwide. Strategy packets will be shipped in advance. Ned will be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting for him. Mr Laskin, the reason we're having this conversation is your position is no longer available. I don't understand. I'm fired? Hearing the words ""You've been let go"" is never easy. Change is always scary, but consider the following: anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it. That's my fucking line. But what happens now? This is the first step of a process that will end with you in a new job that fulfills you. Yeah, but how does it work? Take the packet in front of you. Review it all the answers you're looking for are inside. Start filling out the necessary information and before you know it you will be on your way to new opportunities. Now Ned, I need you to go back to your desk and start putting together your things. As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet. Panic doesn't help anyone. I understand. Give it up for Ned. You can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch, and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line. Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by 85%. And more importantly, to you guys on the road, no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa, no more hours lost to weather delays. You get to come home.";1848;2083

That's why I brought the entire company in from the road, because we're not taking it seriously. There is a methodology to what I do. There is a reason why it works. Coke and IBM have been doing this for years. Are you familiar with them? Like anything else, it'll take a few months to sort of transition and everybody will settle in. Who are you taking off the road? How are you not getting this? You are grounded. Everybody's grounded. It's done. What we do here is brutal and it does leave people devastated.

No, it's OK. I got this. Mr Bingham, I regret to inform you that your position at this company is no longer available. Hm. Who the hell are you? My name is Miss Keener. I'm here today to discuss your future. My future? The only one who can fire me is Craig Gregory. Mr Gregory hired me to handle this for him. Handle what? Handle Me? Mr. Gregory hired me, he's the only one who can fire me. You know what? I'm gonna go talk to him. Mr Bingham... No, no, no. You can't follow me. You're on a computer screen, remember? Right. Let's try this again. Fire me again. I just did. Actually, you didn't. Fire me. That's enough. I think we get it. Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you your position is no longer available. I'm fired? Yes, you're fired. Never say fired. You've been let go. Why? This is a mythical situation. How could I possibly know why? Why doesn't matter, you never know why. It's important to not focus on the why, and rather, spend your energy thinking about your future. Well, I'm gonna spend my energy on suing you unless you give me a good reason why you're firing me. Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important. S you're firing me without grounds? Now I really have a lawsuit. I get what you're trying to say, Ryan. Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham. Personally? This is the most personal situation that you are ever gonna enter, so before you try to revolutionise my business, I'd like to know that you actually know my business.;2135;2309

Start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends, folks around the office. And then you move into the people that you trust with your most intimate secrets your cousins, your aunts, your uncles, your brothers, your sisters, your parents, and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend or your girlfriend. You get them into that backpack. And don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you to light it on fire. Feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake, your relationships are the heaviest components in your life. Do you feel the straps cutting into your shoulders? All those negotiations and arguments, and secrets and compromises. You don't need to carry all that weight. Why don't you set that bag down? Some animals were meant to carry each other, to live symbiotically for a lifetime starcrossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not those animals. The slower we move, the faster we die.

How many stable marriages do you know? Somebody to talk to, someone to spend your life with. I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that's gonna change. How about just not dying alone?

Look, Jim, I'm not going to lie to you. Marriage can be a pain in the ass. And you're kinda right. This all is just stuff that leads to your eventual demise. Yes. And we're all on running clocks. And they can't be slowed down or paused. And...we all end up in the same place. yeah. There is no point. There is no point. That's what I'm saying. You know, uh... I'm not normally the guy you would talk to about stuff like this. If you think about it... your favorite memories, the most important moments in your life. Were you alone? No, I guess not. Come to think of it, last night, the night before your wedding when all this shit is swirling around in your head, weren't you guys sleeping in separate bedrooms?

Glocal? Glocal. Our global must become local. This company keeps 23 people on the road at least 250 days a year. It's expensive and it's inefficient When I came to Craig three months ago with this, he told me, and quite astutely, it's only a problem if you have a solution. Well, today I stand before you with just that. You all know Ned in reception. Today I'm gonna fire Ned. Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR will hire you back this afternoon. We'll see about that. Now Ned could be any employee in any one of our clients' locations worldwide. Strategy packets will be shipped in advance. Ned will be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting for him. Mr Laskin, the reason we're having this conversation is your position is no longer available. I don't understand. I'm fired? Hearing the words ""You've been let go"" is never easy. Change is always scary, but consider the following: anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it. That's my fucking line. But what happens now? This is the first step of a process that will end with you in a new job that fulfills you. Yeah, but how does it work? Take the packet in front of you. Review it all the answers you're looking for are inside. Start filling out the necessary information and before you know it you will be on your way to new opportunities. Now Ned, I need you to go back to your desk and start putting together your things. As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet. Panic doesn't help anyone. I understand. Give it up for Ned. You can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch, and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line. Our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by 85%. And more importantly, to you guys on the road, no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa, no more hours lost to weather delays. You get to come home.";1872;2086

That can't possibly be true. It is. What would account for that? Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China, but here's my question. How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SATs? I didn't know they take SATs in China. They don't. I wasn't talking about China any more, I was talking about me. You got a 1600? Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group, but I can't sing. Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong? I could row crew or invent a $25 PC. Or you could get into a final club. Or I get into a final club. You know, from a woman's perspective, sometimes not singing in an a cappella group is a good thing. This is serious. On the other hand, I do like guys who row crew. Well, I can't do that. I was kidding. And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test. Have you ever tried? I'm trying right now. To row crew? To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like, whatever, delusional? Maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once. I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at. But you've seen guys who row crew, right? No. Okay, well, they're bigger than me. They're worldclass athletes. And a second ago, you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you had met one. I guess I just meant I like the idea of it. You know, the way a girl likes cowboys. Okay. Should we get something to eat? Would you like to talk about something else? No. It's just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club, I think I may have missed a birthday. There are really more people in China with genius lQs than the entire population... The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Pore. Which one? The Porcellian, the Pore. It's the best of the best. Which Roosevelt? Theodore. Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party with the next Fed chairman? So you can see why it's so important to get in. Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into? Why would you ask me that? I was just asking. None of them. That's the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won't come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here. Must be nice. He made $300,000 in a summer? He likes meteorology. You said it was oil futures. You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance. I... What? You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance. The one that's the easiest to get into would be the one where anybody has the best chance. You didn't ask me which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest one. I was honestly just asking, okay? I was just asking to ask. Mark, I'm not speaking in code. Erica. You're obsessed with finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it who will prescribe you some sort of medication. You don't care if the side effects may include blindness. Final clubs. Not ""finals clubs."" And there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated. Yes. There is. Well, you do. That was cryptic, so you do speak in code. I didn't mean to be cryptic. I'm just saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs. Why? Because they're exclusive. And fun, and they lead to a better life. Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club. He was a member of the Porcellian, and yes, he did. Well, why don't you just concentrate on being the best you you can be? Did you really just say that? I was kidding. Just because something's trite doesn't make it less true. I wanna try to be straightforward with you and tell you I think you might want to be a little more supportive. If I get in, I will be taking you to the events and the gatherings, and you'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to meet. You would do that for me? We're dating. Okay. Well, I wanna try and be straightforward with you and let you know that we're not any more. What do you mean? We're not dating any more. I'm sorry. Is this a joke? No, it's not. You're breaking up with me? You're gonna introduce me to people I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet? What the... What is that supposed to mean? Wait, settle down. What is it supposed to mean? Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink right now is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy. ""The door guy""? His name is Bobby. I have not slept with the door guy. The door guy is a friend of mine, and he's a perfectly good class of people. And what part of Long Island are you from, Wimbledon? Wait. Wait, wait. I'm going back to my dorm. Is this real? Yes. Then wait, I apologise, okay? I have to go study. Erica? Yes? I'm sorry, I mean it. I appreciate that, but I have to go study. Come on, you don't have to study. Let's just talk. I can't. Why? Because it is exhausting. Dating you is like dating a StairMaster. All I meant is that you're not likely to... Currently... I wasn't making a comment on your appearance. I was saying that you go to BU. I was stating a fact, that's all, and if it seemed rude, then I apologise. I have to go study. You don't have to study. Why do you keep saying I don't have to study? 'Cause you go to BU. Do you want to get some food? I am sorry you are not sufficiently impressed with my education. And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat, so we're even. I think we should just be friends. I don't want friends. I was just being polite. I have no intention of being friends with you.

You have to do searches, and if your search returns more than 20 matches, nothing gets returned. And once you do get results, they don't link directly to the images. They link to a PHP that redirects or something. Weird. This may be difficult. I'll come back later. Hey, Shark Week's on. What? Great white, beautiful fish. Nice. Leverett is a little better.

That's their own stupidity. I should've been there. Well, darkness is the absence of light, and the stupidity in that instance was the absence of me. Catherine, I've got students in my office now. Students. Undergrads. I don't know. From the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise. All right, byebye. Good morning. Good morning, sir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler. And you're here because... Either of you can answer. I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter. I've read the letter. Well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection... We've since changed the name to ConnectU. And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea... I understand. And I'm asking what you want me to do about it. Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman, under the heading ""Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,"" it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members in this community. Students are required to respect public and private ownership, and instances of theft, misappropriation or... Anne? Yes, sir? Punch me in the face. Go ahead. Or unauthorised use will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the college. And you memorised that instead of doing what? What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully, of course... Sir, it's against university rules to steal from another student, plain and simple. And you've spoken to your House Master? Yes, sir. And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board, but the Ad Board won't see us. Have you tried dealing with the other student directly? Mr Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our emails or phone calls for the last two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland, and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square. You chased him? I saw him and I know he saw me. I went after him and then he disappeared. I don't see this as a university issue. Of course this is a university issue. There's a code of ethics and an honour code and he violated them both. You enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other. I'm sorry, President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all. I'm devastated by that. What my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer, that would be a university issue. I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny. This isn't petty larceny. This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars. Millions? Yes. You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you. Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call. I was the US Treasury Secretary. I'm in some position to make that call. Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshman address. Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project. You would? Yes. Everyone at Harvard's inventing something. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job. So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project. I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point. Please, arrive at the point. You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong. And you're saying that I don't? Of course I'm not saying that, sir. I'm saying that. Really? Sir. Anne, how did they get this appointment? Colleagues of their father. Let me tell you something, Mr Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss, since you're on the subject of right and wrong. This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong. It's not worthy of Harvard. It's not what Harvard saw in you. You don't get special treatment. We never asked... Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for a science fair? If you have a problem with that, Mr Winklevoss... We never asked for special treatment.

The music industry doesn't have a sense of humour. We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties, but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas. So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy. But you made a name for yourself. And you are dry. Tori! No, no, I'm good. And then he went on to his second business venture, which was an online Rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity. And I wanted to do it nice this time.

He had to come to California. And then he got around to The Facebook. So, tell me about your progress. Well, we're in 29 schools now. We got over 75,000 members. Tell me about the strategy you're using. Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas, but Baylor already had a social network on campus. So instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within 100 miles... You put The Facebook on those campuses first. Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw their friends on our site and we were in. It's called the Little Bighorn. That's smart, Mark. Thanks, that was mine. Easy. Hey, you know what? Settle an argument for us. I say it's time to start making money from The Facebook, but Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right? Well... Neither of you yet. The Facebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it. Yeah. You don't wanna ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool. Exactly. It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus and someone's saying it's gotta be over by 11:00. That's exactly right. You don't even know what the thing is yet. Exactly. How big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? You? ""A billion dollars."" And that shut everybody up.

No, but I don't think the guy's holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover. That would be a really big fish and a very strong guy. You think we might be getting away from the point?

At any time in the weeks prior to Mark's telling you his idea, did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection? Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site, but that he looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time. He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys. ""These guys,"" meaning my clients. Yes. He resented... Mark resented that your clients thought that he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash. But Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash, he'd hacked into the Harvard computers, he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety. Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do. Were you aware that while Mr Zuckerberg was building The Facebook, he was also communicating with the plaintiffs? Not at the time, I wasn't. But... It really didn't have much to do with the Winklevosses' dating site. How would you know? You weren't even there. Ty. Were you aware that while Mr Zuckerberg was building The Facebook, he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building Harvard Connection? You're offering a conclusion not found in evidence. We are about to find it in evidence. From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss. November 30th, 2003. ""I read over all the stuff you sent me re: Harvard Connection.

I've never been in this building before. This building's 100 years older than the country it's in, so do be careful. We're sitting in chairs. Yes. Very good. You can go in now. That's their own stupidity. I should've been there. Well, darkness is the absence of light, and the stupidity in that instance was the absence of me. Catherine, I've got students in my office now. Students. Undergrads. I don't know. From the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise. All right, byebye. Good morning. Good morning, sir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler. And you're here because... Either of you can answer. I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter. I've read the letter. Well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection... We've since changed the name to ConnectU. And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea... I understand. And I'm asking what you want me to do about it. Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman, under the heading ""Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,"" it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members in this community. Students are required to respect public and private ownership, and instances of theft, misappropriation or... Anne? Yes, sir? Punch me in the face. Go ahead. Or unauthorised use will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the college. And you memorised that instead of doing what? What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully, of course... Sir, it's against university rules to steal from another student, plain and simple. And you've spoken to your House Master? Yes, sir. And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board, but the Ad Board won't see us. Have you tried dealing with the other student directly? Mr Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our emails or phone calls for the last two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland, and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square. You chased him? I saw him and I know he saw me. I went after him and then he disappeared. I don't see this as a university issue. Of course this is a university issue. There's a code of ethics and an honour code and he violated them both. You enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other. I'm sorry, President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all. I'm devastated by that. What my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer, that would be a university issue. I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny. This isn't petty larceny. This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars. Millions? Yes. You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you. Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call. I was the US Treasury Secretary. I'm in some position to make that call. Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshman address. Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project. You would? Yes. Everyone at Harvard's inventing something. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job. So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project. I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point. Please, arrive at the point. You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong. And you're saying that I don't? Of course I'm not saying that, sir. I'm saying that. Really? Sir. Anne, how did they get this appointment? Colleagues of their father. Let me tell you something, Mr Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss, since you're on the subject of right and wrong. This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong. It's not worthy of Harvard. It's not what Harvard saw in you. You don't get special treatment. We never asked... Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for a science fair? If you have a problem with that, Mr Winklevoss... We never asked for special treatment. The courts are always at your disposal. Is there anything else I can do for you? You can take the Harvard Student Handbook and shove it... Ty. Thank you very much for your time, sir.";5400;5763

Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim, the brave journalist going up against the bad guy. I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven. When you call a guy a criminal... If you want to say these things... Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity. There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel. ... was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel.

I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a fine journalist, who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate. And inaccuracies can't go unanswered. All journalists have to accept, like the rest of us, actions have consequences. Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600,000 Swedish kronor in damages and all court costs.

Together they are the old Sweden and the new. Yes, they are. You know about Harriet, right? You don't? Yes, I do. The family doesn't want to talk about it, but it can't be swept under the rug. What can't? Harriet. We can talk about it later. Uh... We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family. That's why she'll never marry me. That's one reason. I don't want to read about that in the book. Everything else is fine. Harriet certainly. You know, everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the company as well. How so? We're not Ericsson or Nordea. But we're still the largest familyowned company in the country. At our height we had 40,000 employees. We have half of that now. And that downward slide began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit and his heart. Uh... You were here that day? I came in later, after the accident on the bridge, with the 4:30 train. I know it well. A terrible day. And the days after, you know? Searching, not finding. Even worse. This event, Mikael, it has to have a big part in your book.;3487;3678

It's about Henrik and the company. Like I said. It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone. Unlike the one that landed you in court. Unlike that one, yes. So you're not really here to find out what happened to Harriet. I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but, no, that's by no means my focus. Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here, which are where, in the closet now? Those weren't Henrik's investigation? I wonder sometimes who's crazier, my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. Since we're talking about her, since you brought her up, what was she like? What was Harriet like? I'm sure Henrik has told you. He was my age back then. He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager. You were the same age. My sister Anita was closer to her in age. She knew Harriet better than anyone. You should talk to her. I'd love to. Where is she? If I had to guess, London. You don't know where your sister lives? I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along. I'm getting used to that comment. She hates this place more than I do. She left. Moved to London, that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit. I'll track her down for you.

Well, I would be if I had any money. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. I haven't seen him in over 20 years. Actually, it's a lot more than that. Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family. Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid. I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question. Well, then let me narrow it down. I've gotten up to the 1960s, to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life. Harriet. Um, everything that I know about that, I told to whatever his name was. Morell. My recollections were a lot better then. I'm not really speaking about the event itself. I just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. She was very messed up. Well, just like all us Vanger kids, really, but... Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least her father wasn't a Nazi. Was he abusive? Mine? No, hers. Not that I ever saw, but you could tell that something was going on. Some days she'd be very withdrawn. And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school. And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun. No Vanger was ever religious. Can you imagine? She was obviously very unhappy. What do you think happened to her? Everyone knows what. You don't have any thoughts about who or why? All that I know is that I felt really sorry for her. I got away when I was 18 and I never went back. And she'd have done the same. But she never made it to 18. Mr. Bjurman, please.

""if a man lies with a woman having her sickness,"" he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered ""the fountain of her blood."" Raped and stabbed, but cause of death was suffocation by sanitary napkin. Okay. R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957. A cleaning woman and parttime palm reader. Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped. Head crushed with a rock. Leviticus 20:27. ""A woman who is a medium or sorceress shall be put to death by stoning."" I usually like to smoke outside. Sara Witt, 1964. Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed. Raped. Charred in the fire that burned down her house. Leviticus 21:9. ""The daughter of a priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with fire."" Magda Lovisa SjÃ¶berg, 1960. Found in a barn. Stabbed and raped with farm tools. The cow in the next stall had its throat slit. Its blood was splashed on her and hers on it. Leviticus 20:16. ""If a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast. Their blood is upon them."" Lea Persson, 1962. Found by her sister in their pet shop. Raped, beaten. The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums. There was a parakeet inside her. Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled. A burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967. A student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated... Okay. I'm not finished.

It was such a long time ago, which is kind of more to the point than the money he embezzled from you. You're referring to the statute of limitations, but I had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out. If I had, I never would've let him bring you up here. He wasn't trying to deceive you. He knows you can't try somebody 35 years after the event. I like Henrik, but he knows that. A man's reputation means something. He believes that. He thought you could destroy WennerstrÃ¶m in the court of public opinion. The court of public opinion celebrates people's bad behavior. He's an elderly man. He promised me WennerstrÃ¶m's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this. Yes, of course. What happened with WennerstrÃ¶m? How did he get you? I was stupid. I heard something. I got it from an anonymous source, who I'm now sure was one of WennerstrÃ¶m's lackeys. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court. You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about WennerstrÃ¶m? Go on. I did some work on my own on him before you hired me. I haven't looked at it all because you and HarrietfuckingVanger have kept me busy. But I may have something. You may have something? Maybe. They launder money from arms and drug sales and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings. The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. And how do you know this? This time you don't want to know. This time I do want to know. I have access to his computer, and his accountant's and lawyer's. And how do you have that? I could've gotten it from a source inside the company. You didn't. But that's what you'll say. And what will you say to me? Well, that depends if you really want to know. I do. Mikael, how did you get access? Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who, this time last year was convicted of libel In a Stockholm courtroom, doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes. Or maybe he has. In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the company that sued him, the WennerstrÃ¶m Group. The shit hits the fan. Of criminal activities on a global scale.

I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a fine journalist, who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate. And inaccuracies can't go unanswered.

My brothers and their wives and their children and grandchildren were all gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade. Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it. She returned a little after 2:00. She came into the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. It was during those few minutes that something else occurred. The accident had nothing to do with Harriet, and yet everything. Heh. It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing. Police, ambulance, fire brigade, reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side. The driver of the car, a man named Aronsson, was pinned and severely injured. We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands since metal tools might spark. It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital. Just as we from our side slowly drifted back to the house. The sun was down, the excitement over. We sat down to dinner. It was then that I noticed. Harriet wasn't there. And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next 40 years. What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen? And she couldn't have just run away? No. Not without being seen. The firemen stayed out all night on the bridge pumping up gasoline. No one swam across or took a boat. All the boats were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, I checked. She couldn't have just fallen and drowned? No. The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls in the water turns up. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than 10 meters when he drowned the year before. Oh, no. Someone killed her. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. Those are from her. And the rest, from her killer. Who knows about these?

You can't dig up an entire island. But neither could I find the motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated? Did she know something someone wished she didn't? Was it about business? Business? Well, she was 16. And very bright. Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her running the company one day. She was with some friends that day at a parade. She told them she was feeling unwell. She left early. But they also told me she kept secrets from them too. The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated. I have one. Oh, then you know. I wanted to, uh, ahem, ask you about this. She received that from Henrik the Christmas before. I've studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. It's the last page I was curious about. As was I. It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance. All local phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman, Margot, whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died some years before. The other three were not connected in any way that I could find. I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry. I can't forget. It's my Rebecka case. Uh, I don't know what that is. Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over. Back then we had an Officer Torstensson. Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case. Taking out the files, studying them over and over. We were young. We laughed at him. And that was also a missinggirl case? No, no, no, that's not why I mention it. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor old Torstensson never solved it. And he never let it go. So how's Mr. Palmgren doing?;2957;3211

And I am required as the lead on the Go Team to make initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today. You are in a hospital in South Atlanta. Are you aware that the plane you were piloting went down? I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation. I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is you're in good condition. You did suffer a concussion, you have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to keep the patch on for a few days. Just as a precaution. Your eye seems to be okay. Now, the MRls show that you have some strained tendons in your left knee and ankle, and you have no broken bones. But you have some deep bruising in your left thigh and some torn ligaments in your left wrist. Nothing serious. So, as soon as we clear your concussion and you feel well enough, you can go home. That may take a day, maybe three. Okay? I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact. How much do you remember about the flight? I remember... I remember everything up till the crash. Okay. Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life. The current information states that of the 102 souls on board, we lost six. Two crew members and four passengers. Fiftynine people were treated and released, 37 people remain... Who did we lose on the crew? The two flight attendants, Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. The rep from your pilots' union, Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you. It's important that you follow your union's guidance on press and media. The pilots' union works closely with the NTSB. So, I'm going to head out. I'll turn this off. Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.

And they're keeping him in a coma just to let the brain swelling go down, but we feel good about him. He's going to be okay. What are you doing here, Charlie? I'm flying a desk now.

I'm not sure I want to stay at the farm. You're not. You're just gonna drive me to the airport so I can pick up my car. ""Veal""? Really. Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court, I'm with CNN. We'd like... This is the NBC affiliate in Athens. We're looking to... In the wake of the deadly crash of SouthJet flight 227, we have more questions than answers as to what exactly happened that day. And like many, we are out looking for answers. Looking here at the home of pilot Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker. We still have no sighting and no comments from the Captain himself. This is Mark Mellon, still on the hunt, from midtown Atlanta. You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides. Please leave a message and it will be returned. Thank you. Hey, cowboy. It's Charlie again. Listen, I'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight, but they said you'd gone home, so you must be feeling pretty good. Listen, I went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned, so you may be with relatives, which I understand, but I know you have a doctor's appointment early in the morning for your eye, and I was just hoping that you could meet us for breakfast. About 10:00 at the St. Regis, there's an executive buffet there. And we'll be covering some pretty important stuff, so it'd be nice to have you there. All right. Be good.";4112;4664
5500;id_29;5;annotator1;Easy Negative;[];[];74630;81975;tt1907668;Flight;23.976;" All right. Be good. Oh, there he is. Hey, Whip. Hey, buddy. Man, you look good. I feel good. Thanks for coming. Glad you got my message. How's your eye? Good, good. This is Hugh Lang, he's an attorney from Chicago. Pleasure to meet you, Captain. My pleasure. Sit down. You want a coffee? Yes, I do. Could we have some fresh coffee? Yes, sir. We were just talking about your copilot's wife. Told a newspaper that ""God landed that plane."" Yeah? Oh, God landed that plane? Well, I do believe God landed the plane. Same way I believe God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent. I'm fine with coffee, thank you. So, Len Caldwell really wanted to get here this morning. Len's the president of the pilots' union. He wanted to be here to meet with us and you, but they need him at the crash site. As you know, when a plane goes down, the NTSB sends a Go Team to the crash site immediately. They find the flight data recorder? They did. It's perfectly intact. Oh, great. Great, great, great. Then that solves everything. So why do we need a lawyer from Chicago? Well, Hugh specializes in criminal negligence. Criminal negligence? Death demands responsibility. Six dead on that plane, someone has to pay. Yeah, but that's a plane that fell apart at... Thank you. Fell apart at 30,000 feet. The airline will try to prove equipment failure, which is gonna make the manufacturer responsible. The manufacturer in turn is gonna try and prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline. Or pilot error. I flew the plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh. You get the picture? A hundred people, upside down, 500 feet off the ground. Do you have any idea what that's like? I do. I heard the black box recordings last night. Oh, you heard. Are you a pilot? No, I'm not. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, do you? Hugh's on our team, Whip. Is he? Yeah, he is. He doesn't act like he's on our team. Well, he is. Asking me questions about fucking pilot error. Listen, it's the NTSB's ball game. They run the investigation. And they will ultimately rule on the cause. And that's why we need him. Well, they interview the entire flight crew. They interview the passengers. They hold public hearings. All right, let's cut to the chase. Just tell me what it is I need to know, Charlie. The NTSB Go Team also collects blood, hair and skin samples from the entire flight crew for the purposes of a toxicology report. Okay. When do they want to do that? They've already done that. In the hospital. It's the first thing they do. You don't remember having your blood drawn the night of the crash? No. No. They get the results of this test? Yeah, they do. Anything else for you gentlemen? Yeah. You had warm cinnamon buns over there, right? Yes, sir. Could you get me one of those, please? Sure. In fact, get me two of them. Yes, sir. Coming up. Thank you, sweetie. Now, an initial report shows that you had alcohol in your system at a level of .24. Now in the good old U.S. ofA., one of the most lenient drunk driving countries in the world, you go to jail for driving with anything above .08. And by driving, I mean a car. Thank you. So... That doesn't mean anything. I had a couple of beers the night before the flight. That made the tail of the plane explode? A couple of beers? Yeah, a couple of beers. You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie. Hugh is your lawyer. I need a bigger lawyer. I need a lawyer that understands that someone put me in a broken plane. Without me up there, there would have been 102 funerals, not six. We're not talking about funerals right now, Captain. Well, then what are we talking about? We're talking about prison time. What? Lawsuits. Somebody has to pay. What, write a check? It's not gonna be me, I promise you that. As long as they're writing checks, tell them to write one for me, too. Because someone put me in a broken plane. I'd love a check, Charlie. This toxicology report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine. Felonies punishable by up to 12 years in prison. And if it is proven that your intoxication was the cause of the death of the four passengers, now we're gonna look at four counts of manslaughter. That could be life in prison. Now can I please do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report? He's gonna get it done, Whip. He'll get it done. It's what his whole life's about. Trust me. Trust him. You don't have to worry, you'll walk away from this the hero. I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise you that I'm not worried. No one could have landed that plane like I did. No one. Thanks for coming.

Think if it would have sheared off completely, everybody would have walked away from this plane. The wing snapped off and drove the engine cowling into the rear fuselage. Yeah. If you were sitting in the last six or seven rows, it was like being hit by a train. Who are they? The John the Baptist Pentecostal Mission. They helped pull survivors out of the wreckage. Now, they come out here every day. And that is Ellen Block. She's the head of the NTSB investigation. She's the one that's gonna be asking you the tough questions.

The two crew members don't count. I don't mean they don't count. They don't get settlements like the passengers. Okay, that's a workman's comp claim, part of the union contract. They do a dangerous job. They know it. You the lawyer for the pilots' union? No, sir, this is Hugh Lang, he's the attorney we brought on to handle the criminal side of Captain Whitaker's situation. Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation? The NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight. We had to give them access to everything. Everybody's curious about Captain Whitaker. Well, I flew with him in the navy and he is a great pilot. Is he a drunk? He's a heavy drinker. But maybe I should bring him in... In a minute. All right, so let's get down to it, Lenny. What does the union plan to do about this blood test saying Whitaker was high on booze and coke? This guy's a real peach. I'm going to kill the toxicology report. The testing was done incompetently. The toxicology equipment they used was last calibrated in June of 2009. It's already 18 months past code. Their log, that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials, and when, is very incomplete. And they used a preservative in the blood that has been known to cause fermentation, and in some cases, register higher in an alcohol test. Now, I've done all this, I've only been here a few days, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. I can handle this. I like this guy, Lenny. Makes me want to go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet. Mr. Carr, we're going to fight to push all the fault onto the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield. And you think they're gonna just open their checkbook and buy us all lunch? Good fucking luck. What's my exposure, Jim? Well, the awards to the families could kill the airline. Fuck the airline. The insurance companies can have the goddamn airline. I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets. Speaking for the pilots' union, sir, we don't want to see your airline go away. We enjoy the contract you have with us. We're gonna protect Captain Whitaker, and in turn, we're gonna protect your airline. Does Whitaker know he's going to jail? My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr. He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail. The only question is, is he going to die in jail? You're wrong, Mr. Carr. Last time I checked, six counts of manslaughter is life in prison.

So, yeah, we wanted to make this as easy as possible on you. I hope this is okay. You can just relax, get some rest. Order up a steak, get a movie. I made a copy of the entire investigation and my file on you. I was trying to anticipate what kinds of questions they might ask you under oath, and I wrote some nondamaging responses. So, it's all in there. You know, with photos, interviews, there's some testimony in there. I called Ellen Block, told her you're here. You're all tucked in. She got the knife out for me? Well, look, she's not happy that I killed the tox report, but this isn't a trial, so she's very limited in the kinds of questions she can ask you. You know? You're gonna be fine. Yeah, the hearing's at 10:00, so just downstairs, so we're figuring we meet here at 9:00 for breakfast in the room and take it from there. Take it from there. Yeah.

I'll go ahead and tell them we're here. You're going to make it. Remember, if they ask you anything about your drinking, it's totally acceptable to say, ""I don't recall."" Hey, don't tell me how to lie about my drinking, okay? I know how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, hearing officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning. Morning. Morning. What that video captures is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4,800 feet per minute in what is considered a ""full pitch nose down"" attitude. Then, at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created an animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. We're going to roll it. What do you mean ""Roll it""? We gotta do something to stop this dive. Margaret, what's your son's name? Trevor. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" What? Black box. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" I love you, Trevor. You be a good boy. Mommy loves you. Okay, here we go. I've got control. Oh, Lord Jesus! ...flaps. Flaps! Speed brakes. Speed brakes! Margaret! Power! Gear up. Gear up! Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted! We're flying. We're level. We can maintain altitude like... Atlanta Center... SouthJet... 7. We are inverted. L... We are inverted. SouthJet 2... 7, did you say inverted? That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment on board flight 227, wherein you say, ""We're going to roll it."" ""Here we go. I've got control."" You made a very conscious decision to invert the aircraft, to roll the plane upside down, is that correct? I'm not sure if it was conscious. But... it was more like instinct. What led to that decision? I don't recall. Let me quote from an investigative summary. ""From 9:34 until 9:42, ""the events on the aircraft are,"" again I quote, ""bold and remarkable. ""By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent ""and allowed the aircraft to level off, ""enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas"" ""and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field."" I heard a loud metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control. Yes. First Officer Evans' testimony confirms the same. I want to show you something. Nothing's happening. This remote isn't working. Apologies. I can do this manually. This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly that articulates the horizontal stabilizer, also known as the elevator. As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone. This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2011. It was never replaced. It had an additional 1,200 hours of flight on it. It finally failed. Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position, which forced the plane into a dive. The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, ""A catastrophic event from which recovery was improbable"" ""and stable flight impossible."" Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about the days leading and the hours leading up to the accident. But before I do, I want to remind you that you are under oath and that any testimony you give here today will be considered admissible in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings. Do you understand what that means? Captain Whitaker, for the record, I need you to verbalize your answer. I'm sorry. Yes, I understand. On the three days leading up to the accident, Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th, did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements? No, I did not. On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job? No, I did not. Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction? No. Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done. Due to the severe turbulence in the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane, is that correct? Yes, that's correct. I suspended the drink service on the plane. Are you aware that our investigators found two single service vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? Yes, I'm aware of that. There were five crew members on board that would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of these crew members, yourself, First Officer Evans, Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason, and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. Toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons, and one tested positive for alcohol. It registered a .17 blood alcohol level. Are you aware of that? Yeah, I'm aware of it now. Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work, is that correct? Outside of work? No, not really. Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem? No, I did not. Did you ever see her drink to excess? No, I did not. Were you aware that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines. No, I did not. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? Could you repeat the question? Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? I'm sorry, my what? Your opinion, Captain. Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissible in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those two bottles of vodka on the plane? God help me. I'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't hear you. What did you say? I said, ""God help me."" Yes, well, however, is it your opinion... it's my opinion. Trina did not drink that vodka. Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker? She saved the boy's life, that's... Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker? Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka because I drank the vodka. What the hell? Objection! Please be seated, sir. Sir. Captain Whitaker misspoke. I drank the vodka bottles. Didn't you hear me? I said I object! Please be seated, sir. This is not a courtroom. Well, I object anyway! I drank the vodka bottles on the plane. Captain Whitaker, on the three nights before the accident, October 11th... October 11th, October 12th, and 13th and 14th, I was intoxicated. I drank all of those days. I drank. In excess. On the morning of the accident... I was drunk. I'm drunk now. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block. Because I'm an alcoholic. That was it. I was finished. I was done. It was as if I had reached my lifelong limit of lies. I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker, 'cause if I had told just one more lie, I could have walked away from all that mess and kept my wings, kept my false sense of pride. And more importantly, I could have avoided being locked up in here with all you nice folks for the last 13 months. But I'm here. And I'll be here for at least the next four or five years. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's how the judge explained it to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA, they took away my pilot's license. And that's fair. My chances of ever flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. I've had a lot of time to think about it, all of it. I've been doing some writing. I wrote letters to each of the families that had lost loved ones. Some of them were able to hear my apology. Some of them never will. I also apologized to all the people that tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen. People like my wife, you know. My exwife and my son. And again, like I said, you know, some of them will never forgive me. Some of them will. But at least I'm sober. I thank God for that. I'm grateful for that.

The 102 souls on board, including the flight crew, 96 of them survived the crash. Six people died. Two crew, four passengers. Who on the crew? Listen, the protocol is... Who on the crew, Charlie? The protocol is that the NTSB has to be the first to make contact with you. I can't... And that agent's here, so let me go get him. It's a bit of a show. So, just... There's half a dozen of them. All right? Hey, Craig, come on in. Captain William Whitaker? Nod if you can hear me and understand me. I'm Craig Matson from the NT... NTSB. And I am required as the lead on the Go Team to make initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today. You are in a hospital in South Atlanta. Are you aware that the plane you were piloting went down? I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation. I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is you're in good condition. You did suffer a concussion, you have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to keep the patch on for a few days. Just as a precaution. Your eye seems to be okay. Now, the MRls show that you have some strained tendons in your left knee and ankle, and you have no broken bones. But you have some deep bruising in your left thigh and some torn ligaments in your left wrist. Nothing serious. So, as soon as we clear your concussion and you feel well enough, you can go home. That may take a day, maybe three. Okay? I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact. How much do you remember about the flight? I remember... I remember everything up till the crash. Okay. Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life. The current information states that of the 102 souls on board, we lost six. Two crew members and four passengers. Fiftynine people were treated and released, 37 people remain... Who did we lose on the crew? The two flight attendants, Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. The rep from your pilots' union, Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you. It's important that you follow your union's guidance on press and media. The pilots' union works closely with the NTSB. So, I'm going to head out. I'll turn this off. Good luck, Mr. Whitaker. Thank you. I knew Trina Marquez. She was... We spent some time together. Yeah, apparently, she wasn't strapped in. A survivor reported she was assisting a kid. Margaret Thomason, how's she doing? Broken collarbone, just, I mean, cuts. I mean, she's banged up, but she's... She's here, too. She's fine. And Ken Evans, your copilot, he took a bad shot to the head. And they're keeping him in a coma just to let the brain swelling go down, but we feel good about him. He's going to be okay. What are you doing here, Charlie? I'm flying a desk now. I'm a rep for the pilots' union. You're the rep for the pilots' union? Yeah, I'm one of them. When your plane went down, all the reps got a page and I just shot up my hand, 'cause I know you, said I wanted to come be the first face you'd see. I'm glad you're here. The union's gonna release a statement on your behalf, condolences to the families who lost loved ones, gratitude to the brave men and women of the flight crew. That's... You don't have to worry about that. And I know you and Deana have been divorced for a while now, but maybe she and your son, Will, wanna... Yeah, Knuckles... How old is he now? Too old. Fifteen. Fifteen? Wow. Yeah. When we were flying for Delta, you weren't even married. We're dinosaurs, Whip. Do you want me to reach out to Deana? And see if she and Will want to come down... No, no. I'll... I'll call them. All right. Well, speaking of which, I got your phone. And a whole bunch of other personal effects from the plane. Your clothes are toast. Do you... Do you need me to get you some stuff, or... I'm okay. Charlie, I'm... I'm glad you came. Me, too. I'm happy to be here. All right, well, I'm going to... I'll let you get some rest. But I'll come back. I mean, you're going to see plenty of me. I'm sure you will. The plane was fucked, Charlie. It was doomed. I know.

Oh, yeah? They call it chemo brain. My momma, she used to slur her words and get all chatty. Your mom had cancer? Breast cancer. She was only 54. Ls that why you think you're going to die? Heroin addicts who use needles, they tend to die. Especially women, for some reason. I read that in a pamphlet. A woman from AA, she just came to see me whilst I was in rehab.

I'm not sure I want to stay at the farm. You're not. You're just gonna drive me to the airport so I can pick up my car. ""Veal""? Really. Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court, I'm with CNN. We'd like... This is the NBC affiliate in Athens. We're looking to... In the wake of the deadly crash of SouthJet flight 227, we have more questions than answers as to what exactly happened that day. And like many, we are out looking for answers. Looking here at the home of pilot Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker. We still have no sighting and no comments from the Captain himself. This is Mark Mellon, still on the hunt, from midtown Atlanta. You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides. Please leave a message and it will be returned. Thank you. Hey, cowboy. It's Charlie again. Listen, I'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight, but they said you'd gone home, so you must be feeling pretty good. Listen, I went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned, so you may be with relatives, which I understand, but I know you have a doctor's appointment early in the morning for your eye, and I was just hoping that you could meet us for breakfast. About 10:00 at the St. Regis, there's an executive buffet there. And we'll be covering some pretty important stuff, so it'd be nice to have you there. All right. Be good. Oh, there he is. Hey, Whip. Hey, buddy. Man, you look good. I feel good. Thanks for coming. Glad you got my message. How's your eye? Good, good. This is Hugh Lang, he's an attorney from Chicago. Pleasure to meet you, Captain. My pleasure. Sit down. You want a coffee? Yes, I do. Could we have some fresh coffee? Yes, sir. We were just talking about your copilot's wife. Told a newspaper that ""God landed that plane."" Yeah? Oh, God landed that plane? Well, I do believe God landed the plane. Same way I believe God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent. I'm fine with coffee, thank you. So, Len Caldwell really wanted to get here this morning. Len's the president of the pilots' union. He wanted to be here to meet with us and you, but they need him at the crash site. As you know, when a plane goes down, the NTSB sends a Go Team to the crash site immediately. They find the flight data recorder? They did. It's perfectly intact. Oh, great. Great, great, great. Then that solves everything. So why do we need a lawyer from Chicago? Well, Hugh specializes in criminal negligence. Criminal negligence? Death demands responsibility. Six dead on that plane, someone has to pay. Yeah, but that's a plane that fell apart at... Thank you. Fell apart at 30,000 feet. The airline will try to prove equipment failure, which is gonna make the manufacturer responsible. The manufacturer in turn is gonna try and prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline. Or pilot error. I flew the plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh. You get the picture? A hundred people, upside down, 500 feet off the ground. Do you have any idea what that's like? I do. I heard the black box recordings last night. Oh, you heard. Are you a pilot? No, I'm not. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, do you? Hugh's on our team, Whip. Is he? Yeah, he is. He doesn't act like he's on our team. Well, he is. Asking me questions about fucking pilot error. Listen, it's the NTSB's ball game. They run the investigation. And they will ultimately rule on the cause. And that's why we need him. Well, they interview the entire flight crew. They interview the passengers. They hold public hearings. All right, let's cut to the chase. Just tell me what it is I need to know, Charlie. The NTSB Go Team also collects blood, hair and skin samples from the entire flight crew for the purposes of a toxicology report. Okay. When do they want to do that? They've already done that. In the hospital. It's the first thing they do. You don't remember having your blood drawn the night of the crash? No. No. They get the results of this test? Yeah, they do. Anything else for you gentlemen? Yeah. You had warm cinnamon buns over there, right?";4111;4933

Now, an initial report shows that you had alcohol in your system at a level of .24. Now in the good old U.S. ofA., one of the most lenient drunk driving countries in the world, you go to jail for driving with anything above .08. And by driving, I mean a car. Thank you. So... That doesn't mean anything. I had a couple of beers the night before the flight. That made the tail of the plane explode? A couple of beers? Yeah, a couple of beers. You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie. Hugh is your lawyer. I need a bigger lawyer. I need a lawyer that understands that someone put me in a broken plane. Without me up there, there would have been 102 funerals, not six. We're not talking about funerals right now, Captain. Well, then what are we talking about? We're talking about prison time. What? Lawsuits. Somebody has to pay. What, write a check? It's not gonna be me, I promise you that. As long as they're writing checks, tell them to write one for me, too. Because someone put me in a broken plane. I'd love a check, Charlie. This toxicology report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine. Felonies punishable by up to 12 years in prison. And if it is proven that your intoxication was the cause of the death of the four passengers, now we're gonna look at four counts of manslaughter. That could be life in prison. Now can I please do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report? He's gonna get it done, Whip. He'll get it done. It's what his whole life's about. Trust me. Trust him. You don't have to worry, you'll walk away from this the hero. I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise you that I'm not worried. No one could have landed that plane like I did. No one. Thanks for coming. Yeah. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes. Yeah, let me have an orange juice. Large orange juice. Just orange juice? Yeah. No. Double Stoli. Neat. It paints a picture to me anyway of a real American hero. Ls that your reading of it? Absolutely. However, remember, every situation is different. And the actions of the pilots on SouthJet 227 will be heavily scrutinized. Are you suggesting that there may be more to this than meets the eye? There always is. You don't have all the answers. You do have a lot of questions. We're gonna have to wait until some of those answers come in before we can say much more. Are you hinting here, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but are you hinting that this is suspicious? This accident is not like any other accident. And the next one will be Taylor Street. What the fuck, Nicole? Get out!;4944;5345

Think if it would have sheared off completely, everybody would have walked away from this plane. The wing snapped off and drove the engine cowling into the rear fuselage. Yeah. If you were sitting in the last six or seven rows, it was like being hit by a train. Who are they? The John the Baptist Pentecostal Mission. They helped pull survivors out of the wreckage. Now, they come out here every day. And that is Ellen Block. She's the head of the NTSB investigation. She's the one that's gonna be asking you the tough questions. I drank the night before the flight. I drank that morning, too. I used cocaine to help straighten myself out. I know. It's in the toxicology report. But that is not the reason why this happened. No, it's not. Listen. Clearly, there was a mechanical issue with the plane. Yeah, clearly. Yeah, but what you and I know, this was an act of God. And I'm going to fight to get the NTSB to add ""Act of God"" as one of the probable causes. Whose god would do this? Okay. So, here's the deal. Avington Carr, he's the owner of the airline, he's on our side. He's got big friends in Washington, too. He wants to have a sitdown with us tomorrow morning at 10:00. Good. Yeah. You can't drink, Captain. You're under the microscope right now. You can't be seen buying liquor. That means no bars, no drugs... I understand. I won't drink, I promise you.

No, no, it's four, Lenny. The two crew members don't count. I don't mean they don't count. They don't get settlements like the passengers. Okay, that's a workman's comp claim, part of the union contract. They do a dangerous job. They know it. You the lawyer for the pilots' union?

What does the union plan to do about this blood test saying Whitaker was high on booze and coke? This guy's a real peach. I'm going to kill the toxicology report. The testing was done incompetently. The toxicology equipment they used was last calibrated in June of 2009. It's already 18 months past code. Their log, that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials, and when, is very incomplete. And they used a preservative in the blood that has been known to cause fermentation, and in some cases, register higher in an alcohol test. Now, I've done all this, I've only been here a few days, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. I can handle this. I like this guy, Lenny. Makes me want to go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet. Mr. Carr, we're going to fight to push all the fault onto the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield. And you think they're gonna just open their checkbook and buy us all lunch? Good fucking luck. What's my exposure, Jim? Well, the awards to the families could kill the airline. Fuck the airline. The insurance companies can have the goddamn airline. I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets. Speaking for the pilots' union, sir, we don't want to see your airline go away. We enjoy the contract you have with us. We're gonna protect Captain Whitaker, and in turn, we're gonna protect your airline. Does Whitaker know he's going to jail? My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr. He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail. The only question is, is he going to die in jail? You're wrong, Mr. Carr. Last time I checked, six counts of manslaughter is life in prison.

I always love a meeting where we all have to identify at the top, because it forces me to be honest about who I really am. And I never told the truth out there, obviously. I lied about everything. I was taught in these rooms that I would never get sober if I kept lying, but that's what I was best at. If I knew anything in this world it was how to lie, especially about my drinking. But, whatever. I would lie about the name of my dog, I'd lie about the color of my own hair right to your face. And my whole life just became a series of lies strung together by me, one after the other. I'm going to go, okay? Sure. You got a ride home? Yeah. Sheila, she can give me a ride. This is Sheila.

You were brilliant on CNN, by the way. Both my legs are crushed. My pelvis is snapped. I'll probably never walk again, at least not without a walker or braces. I'll certainly never fly again. I'm very sorry, Ken. That plane was doomed the moment you sat in that cockpit. You reeked like gin or something. I called Vicky from the plane before we took off. That's when the rain kicked up. Well, I don't know how much you remember, but that plane, it started falling apart, Ken. I remember everything until we crashed. I know what went on. What are we trying to say, Ken? What are we talking about? I don't know, Captain Whitaker. What are we talking about? I'm just trying to get a sense from you about what you thought caused the crash. Was it the fact that you got on the plane still drunk from the night before? The NTSB is coming back tomorrow to finish taking a deposition from me. About the events on that flight. Do you think you'd be alive if I wasn't flying that plane? No. We'd all be dead. But are you going to argue with me that your physical state was tiptop? Wait. Sit. Please. I never shared my opinion about your physical state the morning of the flight. I never said a word. Okay. That crash was preordained. I prayed on it, Captain. Vicky and I both prayed on it. There is only one judge, sir. Praise Jesus. And he's got a higher plan for you. This event, although it's tragic in its loss of life, it's also a celebration of life. Nothing happens in the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake, sir. Praise Jesus. Captain. Will you pray with us? Jesus, our savior, we thank you for blessing Captain Whitaker. For guiding his hand on that fateful morning. Bye. Byebye. Thanks for the ride. Okay. Hi. Hey, hey. How you doing? Oh, hey. Look. Great, right? It's kind of beautiful. It is beautiful, isn't it?

They can be tough, but you just gotta be sharp. Stay focused. Answer the questions correctly. That's right, but we're good. All right, I've successfully had an ""Act of God"" added to the NTSB's list of probable causes. We've shifted suspicion away from you. It's no longer a question of your condition, but the condition of the plane. Fantastic. That's what I've been trying to tell everybody. This is a broken plane. That's right. What about my toxicology report? Oh, I killed that. There is no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane, and no eyewitnesses. So why are we here? We're good. Because there is a small problem. Because of turbulence, there was no drink service on the flight, but they did find two empty vodka bottles in the galley trash. Yeah... And there's no physical evidence on the bottles. No DNA, no fingerprints to link them to anyone, but they were uncapped and empty. And the only people who would have had access to those bottles would be the flight crew. Now, Margaret, Evans and Camelia Satou, they all had clean tox reports, so that only leaves you and... Trina Marquez. Right, Trina Marquez. Okay. Okay, I see where we're going here. That's funny, though, you know, they only found two bottles. Why is that? I drank three. One's missing. You know, when I first met you, I couldn't believe what a drunk, arrogant scumbag you were. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, thank you, Hugh. But I did the research, Captain Whitaker. I heard the expert analysis, and I got to tell you, I'm in awe of what you did. The FAA and the NTSB took 10 pilots, placed them in simulators, recreated the events that led to this plane falling out of the sky. Do you know how many of them were able to safely land the planes? Not one. Every pilot crashed the aircraft, killed everybody on board. You were the only one who could do it. Great. I'm going home. Hey, wait, Whip. You can't... Captain Whitaker, I'm telling you right now, you walk away... Listen, man. ...you're going to prison. I'm trying to save your fucking life. What fucking life? Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh. Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing is a federal agency hearing. Do you understand that? Yes, I understand that. Okay. Well, we can't play around with these people.

I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, hearing officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning. Morning. Morning. What that video captures is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4,800 feet per minute in what is considered a ""full pitch nose down"" attitude. Then, at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created an animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. We're going to roll it. What do you mean ""Roll it""? We gotta do something to stop this dive. Margaret, what's your son's name? Trevor. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" What? Black box. Say, ""I love you, Trevor."" I love you, Trevor. You be a good boy. Mommy loves you. Okay, here we go. I've got control. Oh, Lord Jesus! ...flaps. Flaps! Speed brakes. Speed brakes! Margaret! Power! Gear up. Gear up! Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted! We're flying. We're level. We can maintain altitude like... Atlanta Center... SouthJet... 7. We are inverted. L... We are inverted. SouthJet 2... 7, did you say inverted? That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment on board flight 227, wherein you say, ""We're going to roll it."" ""Here we go. I've got control."" You made a very conscious decision to invert the aircraft, to roll the plane upside down, is that correct? I'm not sure if it was conscious. But... it was more like instinct. What led to that decision? I don't recall. Let me quote from an investigative summary. ""From 9:34 until 9:42, ""the events on the aircraft are,"" again I quote, ""bold and remarkable. ""By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent ""and allowed the aircraft to level off, ""enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas"" ""and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field."" I heard a loud metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control. Yes. First Officer Evans' testimony confirms the same. I want to show you something. Nothing's happening. This remote isn't working. Apologies. I can do this manually. This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly that articulates the horizontal stabilizer, also known as the elevator. As you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone. This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of 2011. It was never replaced. It had an additional 1,200 hours of flight on it. It finally failed. Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position, which forced the plane into a dive. The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, ""A catastrophic event from which recovery was improbable"" ""and stable flight impossible."" Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about the days leading and the hours leading up to the accident. But before I do, I want to remind you that you are under oath and that any testimony you give here today will be considered admissible in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings. Do you understand what that means? Captain Whitaker, for the record, I need you to verbalize your answer. I'm sorry. Yes, I understand. On the three days leading up to the accident, Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th, did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements? No, I did not. On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job? No, I did not. Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency,";9943;10885
5612;id_77;5;annotator2;Easy Negative;[];[];174171;185767;tt1907668;Flight;23.976;" a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction? No. Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done. Due to the severe turbulence in the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane, is that correct? Yes, that's correct. I suspended the drink service on the plane. Are you aware that our investigators found two single service vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? Yes, I'm aware of that. There were five crew members on board that would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of these crew members, yourself, First Officer Evans, Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason, and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez. Toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons, and one tested positive for alcohol. It registered a .17 blood alcohol level. Are you aware of that? Yeah, I'm aware of it now. Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work, is that correct? Outside of work? No, not really. Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem? No, I did not. Did you ever see her drink to excess? No, I did not. Were you aware that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines. No, I did not. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? Could you repeat the question? Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? I'm sorry, my what? Your opinion, Captain. Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissible in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those two bottles of vodka on the plane? God help me. I'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't hear you. What did you say? I said, ""God help me."" Yes, well, however, is it your opinion... it's my opinion. Trina did not drink that vodka. Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker? She saved the boy's life, that's... Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker? Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka because I drank the vodka. What the hell? Objection! Please be seated, sir. Sir. Captain Whitaker misspoke. I drank the vodka bottles. Didn't you hear me? I said I object! Please be seated, sir. This is not a courtroom. Well, I object anyway! I drank the vodka bottles on the plane. Captain Whitaker, on the three nights before the accident, October 11th... October 11th, October 12th, and 13th and 14th, I was intoxicated. I drank all of those days. I drank. In excess. On the morning of the accident... I was drunk. I'm drunk now. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block. Because I'm an alcoholic. That was it. I was finished. I was done. It was as if I had reached my lifelong limit of lies. I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker, 'cause if I had told just one more lie, I could have walked away from all that mess and kept my wings, kept my false sense of pride. And more importantly, I could have avoided being locked up in here with all you nice folks for the last 13 months. But I'm here. And I'll be here for at least the next four or five years. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's how the judge explained it to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA, they took away my pilot's license. And that's fair. My chances of ever flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. I've had a lot of time to think about it, all of it. I've been doing some writing. I wrote letters to each of the families that had lost loved ones. Some of them were able to hear my apology. Some of them never will. I also apologized to all the people that tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen. People like my wife, you know. My exwife and my son. And again, like I said, you know, some of them will never forgive me. Some of them will. But at least I'm sober.";10885;11610

Did you kill your wife, Nick? I did not kill my wife. I am not a murderer. But you were unfaithful. I was unfaithful. And I am deeply ashamed. And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents... Her friends, all the people in your hometown... Believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife. Well, I am desperate to find my missing wife. You say that, but I'm wondering how you expect us to believe you... Now that we know you're a liar. I didn't come forward with my affair... Because I knew it would make me look really, really bad. But I don't care about that anymore. I just want to find my wife. I'm just trying to get clear... let me be clear. Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy. I'm not a good guy. I was a bad husband to a great wife. I broke the vow that I made to her. Those are pretty words, Nick. But what does that really mean to you? It basically means that I was a con artist. I met Amy elliott seven years ago. I was completely transfixed. Amy can do that to you. I was this average guy from an average place... With mediocre aspirations. And I met a woman who dazzled me. And I wanted her to love me... So I pretended to be better than I was. When we got married, I promised to be that guy. That guy who works harder. That guy who, who lives and acts... And loves with as much passion as she does. But I failed her. Instead of doing what was right... I did what was easy. You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife. Who believes his wife is still alive. She is still alive. Will you look at that camera for me? Will you look in the lens... And talk to your wife? If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight... What would you like to say to her, Nick? Amy, I love you. You're the best person I've ever known. And I've taken myself to the woodshed for the way that I've treated you. And if you come back, I promise... I will spend every day making it up to you.

And yet, they remained upright throughout this lifeanddeath struggle? I don't know. What do you want me to say? Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing? No. Because our guys did a luminol test. And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up. Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick. A lot. Oh, my God. Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up. Wait a second. Why would they mop up the blood... If they're trying to stage a crime scene? No blood and no body suggests kidnapping. It tells us, look at people outside the house. Like these homeless you keep mentioning. A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide. It tells us to look at people inside the house. Which is what we're doing here, Nick. I see. So, how was your marriage, Nick? Because right now, all we got is noelle. She says, ""not good."" Gil, what do you and your wife argue about? What pisses you off? Money, lack thereof. Me and my ex, it's the same. I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick. $117,000 in credit card debt. What? I pulled up some of the merchandise. There are these fun little splurges. I didn't buy any of this stuff. I don't even golf! I do! You bought great clubs. I like the robot dog. This is identity theft! This is a felony! We need to find out who did this! All right. Let's talk about life insurance. Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance... To $1.2 million. Yes, I did. That was her idea. She wanted me to. You filed the paperwork.
